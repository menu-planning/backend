# Product Requirements Document: Test Suite Refactoring

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the refactoring of two critical test files (`test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py` and `test_api_meal_comprehensive.py`) to improve maintainability, readability, and reliability. The refactoring aims to simplify factory usage, reduce test complexity, improve performance test reliability, and add explicit data tests.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues

1. **Data Opacity**: Factory methods obscure actual test data, making it difficult to understand what scenarios are being tested
2. **Test Maintenance**: Heavy use of external factories increases maintenance burden and coupling between components
3. **Performance Test Reliability**: Performance assertions using fixed time limits may be unreliable across different environments
4. **Test Complexity**: Complex tests combine multiple concerns, making them difficult to debug and maintain

### Impact

- **Developer Experience**: Difficult to understand test failures and debug issues
- **Maintenance Cost**: High coupling with factory methods increases refactoring overhead
- **CI/CD Reliability**: Performance tests may fail unpredictably in different environments
- **Test Coverage**: Complex tests make it hard to verify specific edge cases

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Simplify Factory Usage**: Replace complex factory methods with simple, explicit test data
2. **Reduce Test Complexity**: Break down complex tests into focused, single-purpose tests
3. **Improve Performance Tests**: Make performance assertions more environment-agnostic
4. **Add Explicit Data Tests**: Include tests with explicit, readable test data

### Success Metrics

- Reduce factory method dependency by 70%
- Increase test readability score (based on code review)

## Technical Approach

### 1. Factory Usage Simplification

#### Current State Analysis
```python
# Current approach - opaque factory usage
def test_complex_recipe_conversion(self):
    recipe = create_complex_api_recipe()  # What data is this?
    domain_recipe = recipe.to_domain()
    assert domain_recipe.name == recipe.name
```

#### Target State
```python
# Proposed approach - explicit test data
def test_complex_recipe_conversion(self):
    recipe = ApiRecipe(
        id="123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
        name="Chicken Parmesan",
        instructions="1. Bread chicken 2. Fry 3. Add sauce",
        author_id="author-123",
        meal_id="meal-456",
        ingredients=frozenset([
            ApiIngredient(name="Chicken", quantity=1, unit="lb"),
            ApiIngredient(name="Parmesan", quantity=0.5, unit="cup")
        ]),
        tags=frozenset([ApiTag(name="Italian", author_id="author-123")]),
        ratings=frozenset([ApiRating(taste=4, convenience=3)]),
        privacy=Privacy.PUBLIC,
        created_at=datetime(2024, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0),
        updated_at=datetime(2024, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0),
        discarded=False,
        version=1
    )
    
    domain_recipe = recipe.to_domain()
    assert domain_recipe.name == "Chicken Parmesan"
    assert len(domain_recipe.ingredients) == 2
```

### 2. Test Complexity Reduction

#### Current State Analysis
```python
# Current approach - complex multi-assertion test
def test_round_trip_with_edge_cases(self, edge_case_recipes, case_name):
    recipe = edge_case_recipes[case_name]
    domain_recipe = recipe.to_domain()
    recovered_api = ApiRecipe.from_domain(domain_recipe)
    # Multiple assertions testing different aspects
    assert recovered_api.id == recipe.id
    assert recovered_api.name == recipe.name
    assert len(recovered_api.ingredients) == len(recipe.ingredients)
    assert len(recovered_api.ratings) == len(recipe.ratings)
```

#### Target State
```python
# Proposed approach - focused single-purpose tests
def test_round_trip_preserves_basic_fields(self):
    recipe = self._create_simple_recipe()
    domain_recipe = recipe.to_domain()
    recovered_api = ApiRecipe.from_domain(domain_recipe)
    
    assert recovered_api.id == recipe.id
    assert recovered_api.name == recipe.name

def test_round_trip_preserves_ingredient_count(self):
    recipe = self._create_recipe_with_ingredients()
    domain_recipe = recipe.to_domain()
    recovered_api = ApiRecipe.from_domain(domain_recipe)
    
    assert len(recovered_api.ingredients) == len(recipe.ingredients)

def test_round_trip_preserves_rating_count(self):
    recipe = self._create_recipe_with_ratings()
    domain_recipe = recipe.to_domain()
    recovered_api = ApiRecipe.from_domain(domain_recipe)
    
    assert len(recovered_api.ratings) == len(recipe.ratings)
```

### 3. Performance Test Improvement

#### Current State Analysis
```python
# Current approach - fixed time limits
def test_from_domain_performance(self, domain_recipe):
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    for _ in range(100):
        ApiRecipe.from_domain(domain_recipe)
    end_time = time.perf_counter()
    avg_time_ms = ((end_time - start_time) / 100) * 1000
    assert avg_time_ms < 5.0, f"Performance too slow: {avg_time_ms}ms"
```

#### Target State
```python
# Proposed approach - relative performance
def test_from_domain_performance(self):
    # Baseline: simple operation
    simple_recipe = self._create_minimal_recipe()
    baseline_time = self._measure_conversion_time(simple_recipe, iterations=100)
    
    # Complex operation
    complex_recipe = self._create_complex_recipe()
    complex_time = self._measure_conversion_time(complex_recipe, iterations=100)
    
    # Relative assertion: complex should be less than 5x baseline
    assert complex_time < baseline_time * 5, \
        f"Complex conversion too slow: {complex_time/baseline_time:.2f}x baseline"
    
    # Environment-agnostic threshold
    max_reasonable_time = max(baseline_time * 10, 0.1)  # 10x baseline or 100ms
    assert complex_time < max_reasonable_time

def _measure_conversion_time(self, recipe, iterations=100):
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    for _ in range(iterations):
        ApiRecipe.from_domain(recipe)
    end_time = time.perf_counter()
    return (end_time - start_time) / iterations
```

### 4. Explicit Data Tests

#### Test Data Constants
