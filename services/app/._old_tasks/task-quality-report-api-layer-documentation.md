# Task Quality Report: API Layer Documentation

## Overall Score: 9/10

### Structure Quality: 3/3
- Folder organization: ✓ - Proper `/tasks/api-layer-documentation/` structure
- File naming: ✓ - Consistent `phase_N.md` format and `guide.md`
- Token limits: ✓ - All files under specified limits (guide: 100 lines, phases: 78-141 lines)

### Content Quality: 4/4
- Task clarity: 2/2 - Clear, actionable tasks with specific file paths and purposes
- Technical accuracy: 2/2 - Patterns align with PRD requirements and clean architecture principles

### Completeness: 2/3
- Testing strategy: ✓ - Comprehensive testing approach with specific commands
- Risk mitigation: ✓ - Clear risk identification and mitigation strategies
- Success criteria: ⚠️ - Success criteria present but could be more measurable in execution

## Issues Found
1. Minor: Some tasks could benefit from more specific time estimates per task
2. Minor: Phase dependencies could be more explicit in individual phase files

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding specific validation checkpoints for each major deliverable
2. Add cross-references between phases for better navigation
3. Include rollback strategies for failed validations

## Detailed Assessment

### Phase Structure Analysis
