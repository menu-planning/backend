## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: Multiple components need testing (domain, services, integrations), external TypeForm API integration requires special handling, and comprehensive test infrastructure needs establishment. However, it's following established recipes_catalog patterns and has clear boundaries, keeping it from detailed complexity.

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: new feature (test infrastructure development)
- **Scope**: creating new test components with minimal existing code modification
- **Test Coverage**: currently minimal in client_onboarding context, unlike recipes_catalog

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: TypeForm API changes breaking tests, complex webhook signature validation scenarios
- **Dependencies**: recipes_catalog test patterns, TypeForm API stability, local development workflow integration
- **Breaking Potential**: low - new test infrastructure shouldn't break existing functionality

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: standard (multiple phases with clear task breakdown)
- **Testing Strategy**: behavioral testing with fakes over mocks, following team guidelines
- **Special Considerations**: must mirror recipes_catalog patterns, prioritize TypeForm integration testing

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 3 phases (foundation, service testing, integration & polish)
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 not needed (clear requirements already defined)
- **Estimated Complexity**: 2-3 weeks (15-20 days as indicated in PRD)
