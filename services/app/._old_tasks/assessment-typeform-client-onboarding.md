## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: New bounded context with external API integration, webhook processing, and recipes_catalog integration. Multiple components but isolated scope with clear boundaries.

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: new feature (new bounded context)
- **Scope**: new components with simplified architecture
- **Test Coverage**: new codebase - comprehensive testing needed

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: TypeForm API reliability, webhook signature verification, Lambda cold starts
- **Dependencies**: TypeForm API, AWS Lambda, recipes_catalog context integration
- **Breaking Potential**: low (isolated context, backward compatible Client model changes)

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: standard
- **Testing Strategy**: unit tests for logic + integration tests for webhooks + manual E2E
- **Special Considerations**: simplified architecture (Pydantic + SQLAlchemy ORM, direct event handling)

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 4 phases (Core Integration, Data Processing, recipes_catalog Integration, Testing & Deployment)
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 needed: no
- **Estimated Complexity**: 4 weeks (as per PRD timeline)
