# PRD: Client Onboarding Test Suite Development

---
feature: client-onboarding-test-suite
complexity: standard
created: 2024-12-28
version: 1.0
---

## Overview
**Problem**: The client_onboarding context lacks comprehensive test coverage, making feature development risky and preventing confident refactoring. Unlike recipes_catalog which has robust test infrastructure, client_onboarding has minimal testing, particularly for critical TypeForm integration.

**Solution**: Develop a complete test suite mirroring recipes_catalog patterns but tailored for the simpler client_onboarding domain. Focus on behavioral testing with fake implementations over mocks, prioritizing TypeForm integration reliability.

**Value**: Enables confident feature development, ensures integration stability, reduces production bugs, and provides foundation for future client onboarding enhancements.

## Goals & Scope

### Goals
1. Achieve 90%+ test coverage for core domain logic (commands, events, business rules)
2. Establish comprehensive TypeForm API integration testing with realistic scenarios
3. Create robust webhook processing pipeline behavioral tests
4. Build reusable test data factories following recipes_catalog patterns
5. Implement fake services for external dependencies to avoid brittle mocks

### Out of Scope
1. Integration tests with recipes_catalog context (entity updates pending)
2. Performance/load testing of webhook endpoints
3. End-to-end UI testing for client interfaces
4. Security penetration testing
5. Compliance/regulatory testing scenarios

## User Stories

### Story 1: Domain Logic Testing
**As a** backend developer **I want** comprehensive domain tests **So that** I can confidently modify business logic without breaking existing behavior
- [ ] All domain commands have unit tests with valid/invalid scenarios
- [ ] All domain events are tested for proper data structure and validation
- [ ] Business rules are tested independently of implementation details
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are covered

### Story 2: TypeForm Integration Testing
**As a** developer **I want** reliable TypeForm API tests **So that** integration changes don't break production webhook processing
- [ ] TypeForm client operations (CRUD) are tested with fake API responses
- [ ] Authentication and error handling scenarios are covered
- [ ] Webhook signature validation is thoroughly tested
- [ ] Rate limiting and retry logic behavior is verified

### Story 3: Test Infrastructure
**As a** team member **I want** consistent test utilities **So that** writing new tests is efficient and follows established patterns
- [ ] Data factories create realistic test scenarios deterministically
- [ ] Test utilities handle common setup/teardown operations
- [ ] Fake services provide consistent external dependency behavior
- [ ] Test execution is fast (<30 seconds) and reliable

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Mirror recipes_catalog test structure: `/tests/contexts/client_onboarding/`
- Organize by layers: `core/`, `data_factories/`, test utilities
- Implement fake services for TypeForm API avoiding network calls
- Use dependency injection for testable service layer

### Data Requirements
- Deterministic test data following recipes_catalog patterns
- Realistic client onboarding scenarios (form submissions, webhook payloads)
- TypeForm API response fixtures for various scenarios
- Webhook security test data (valid/invalid signatures)

### Integration Points
- TypeForm API client with configurable fake/real implementations
- Webhook processing pipeline with event publishing
- Database operations through unit of work pattern
- Configuration management for test/production environments

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Domain Testing Infrastructure
**Description**: Complete test coverage for all domain entities, commands, and events
**Priority**: P0
- Unit tests for `SetupOnboardingFormCommand`, `UpdateWebhookUrlCommand`
- Event testing for `FormResponseReceived`, `ClientDataExtracted`, `OnboardingFormWebhookSetup`
- Role and permission validation testing
- Value object behavior verification

### FR2: TypeForm Integration Testing
**Description**: Comprehensive testing of TypeForm API client and webhook processing
**Priority**: P0
- Fake TypeForm API implementation for consistent testing
- Webhook signature validation with valid/invalid scenarios
- Form operations (create, read, update, delete) with error handling
- API rate limiting and retry behavior testing

### FR3: Service Layer Testing
**Description**: Behavioral testing of all service classes
**Priority**: P1
- `WebhookHandler` processing with realistic payloads
- `TypeFormClient` operations with fake API responses
- `EventPublisher` behavior verification
- Error handling and exception propagation testing

### FR4: Test Data Management
**Description**: Reusable factories and utilities for test data creation
**Priority**: P1
- Domain entity factories with deterministic values
- TypeForm API response fixtures library
- Webhook payload generators for various scenarios
- Database seed data for integration testing

## Quality Requirements

### Performance
- Test suite execution under 30 seconds for developer workflow
- Individual test methods under 100ms execution time
- Memory efficient test data creation (no large fixtures)

### Reliability
- Zero flaky tests - deterministic behavior only
- Tests pass consistently in CI/CD environment
- Proper test isolation without shared state

### Maintainability
- Clear test naming following behavior specification patterns
- Minimal duplication through shared utilities
- Easy to understand test scenarios for new team members

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests
- Pure domain logic testing without external dependencies
- Command and event behavior verification
- Business rule validation with edge cases
- Value object immutability and validation

### Integration Tests
- Service layer with fake external dependencies
- Database operations through repository patterns
- Event publishing and subscription flows
- Configuration-driven behavior testing

### Behavioral Tests
- End-to-end webhook processing scenarios
- TypeForm form lifecycle management
- Client data extraction and validation workflows
- Error handling and recovery behaviors

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Set up test directory structure mirroring recipes_catalog
- [ ] Create basic data factories for domain entities
- [ ] Implement core domain unit tests (commands, events)
- [ ] Set up test utilities and shared infrastructure

### Phase 2: Service Testing (Week 2)
- [ ] Build fake TypeForm API implementation
- [ ] Create comprehensive webhook handler tests
- [ ] Implement TypeForm client integration tests
- [ ] Add event publisher behavioral testing

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish (Week 3)
- [ ] Complete webhook processing pipeline tests
- [ ] Add comprehensive error scenario testing
- [ ] Performance optimization for test execution
- [ ] Documentation and test maintenance guidelines

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Metrics
- Domain logic: 95%+ line coverage
- Service layer: 90%+ line coverage
- Integration points: 100% of TypeForm operations tested

### Quality Metrics
- Test execution time: <30 seconds full suite
- Zero flaky test failures in CI over 1 month
