  - Purpose: Test complete webhook lifecycle management
  - Completed: Comprehensive test suite with 14 test cases covering full webhook lifecycle: setup, update, disable, enable, delete, status checking, bulk operations, synchronization, and error handling using fake implementations

## 2.5 Configuration Validation
- [x] 2.5.1 Add configuration validation
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/config.py`
  - Purpose: Validate rate limiting and webhook configuration on startup
  - Completed: Comprehensive validation with Pydantic validators for rate limiting compliance, security settings, and startup configuration validation with logging
- [x] 2.5.2 Update container configuration
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/core/bootstrap/container.py`
  - Purpose: Update webhook_manager factory (lines 37-40) with new capabilities
  - Completed: Enhanced container with webhook manager factory using validated configuration, comprehensive status tracking, and operational context support
