# Phase 3: Reliability & Retry Logic

---
phase: 3
depends_on: [phase_1, phase_2]
estimated_time: 24 hours (3 days)

- [x] 3.4.3 Webhook status management
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_manager.py`
  - Purpose: Update webhook status based on retry outcomes (integrated in task 3.1.1)

## 3.5 Monitoring and Alerting
- [x] 3.5.1 Add retry metrics collection
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`

- [x] 3.5.2 Implement alerting for retry failures
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Alert on high retry rates or permanent failures (completed in task 3.1.1)
- [x] 3.5.3 Add retry dashboard support
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Expose metrics for operational dashboard monitoring (completed in task 3.1.1)

## 3.6 Integration and Testing
- [x] 3.6.1 Create retry logic unit tests
  - Files: `tests/contexts/client_onboarding/services/test_webhook_retry.py` (NEW)
  - Purpose: Test retry algorithms, backoff, and failure conditions
- [x] 3.6.2 Add integration tests for retry scenarios
  - Files: `tests/contexts/client_onboarding/integration/test_webhook_reliability.py` (NEW)  
  - Purpose: Test complete retry flow with simulated failures
- [x] 3.6.3 Create performance tests for retry under load
  - Files: `tests/contexts/client_onboarding/performance/test_retry_performance.py` (NEW)
  - Purpose: Verify retry performance under high volume
