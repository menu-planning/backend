## Objective
Analyze current endpoint implementations across all contexts to understand patterns, identify inconsistencies, and establish baseline metrics for the refactoring effort.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Access to all three contexts (products_catalog, recipes_catalog, iam)
- [ ] Understanding of existing IAMProvider integration
- [ ] Knowledge of MessageBus and UnitOfWork patterns

# Tasks

## 0.1 Current State Analysis
- [x] 0.1.1 Audit products_catalog endpoints
  - Files: `src/contexts/products_catalog/aws_lambda/*.py`
  - Purpose: Document current structure, error handling, auth patterns
  - Artifacts: `phase_0_products_analysis.md`
  - Completed by: Phase 0 execution
- [x] 0.1.2 Audit recipes_catalog endpoints
  - Files: `src/contexts/recipes_catalog/aws_lambda/*.py`
  - Purpose: Document current structure, identify differences from products
  - Artifacts: `phase_0_recipes_analysis.md`
  - Added by: Phase 0 execution
- [x] 0.1.3 Audit iam endpoints
  - Files: `src/contexts/iam/aws_lambda/*.py`
  - Purpose: Document current structure, note auth handling specifics
  - Artifacts: `phase_0_iam_analysis.md`
  - Added by: Phase 0 execution
- [x] 0.1.4 Create inconsistency report
  - Files: `phase_0_inconsistency_report.md`
  - Purpose: Document all identified inconsistencies and patterns
  - Artifacts: `phase_0_inconsistency_report.md`
  - Added by: Phase 0 execution

## 0.2 Dependency Analysis
- [x] 0.2.1 Map IAMProvider usage patterns
  - Files: All aws_lambda files using IAMProvider
  - Purpose: Understand current auth integration points
  - Artifacts: `phase_0_iam_provider_analysis.md`
  - Added by: Phase 0 execution
- [x] 0.2.2 Catalog MessageBus command/query patterns
  - Files: All aws_lambda files using MessageBus
  - Purpose: Document command/query handling variations
  - Artifacts: `phase_0_messagebus_analysis.md`
  - Added by: Phase 0 execution
- [x] 0.2.3 Review CORS implementation differences
  - Files: `src/contexts/*/aws_lambda/CORS_headers.py` and usage in endpoints
  - Purpose: Identify CORS handling inconsistencies
  - Artifacts: `phase_0_cors_analysis.md`
  - Added by: Phase 0 execution

## 0.3 Performance Baseline
- [ ] 0.3.1 Set up performance testing framework
  - Files: `tests/performance/baseline_tests.py`
  - Purpose: Establish current endpoint performance metrics
- [ ] 0.3.2 Run baseline performance tests
  - Purpose: Record response times, memory usage for comparison
- [ ] 0.3.3 Document performance baseline
  - Files: `docs/performance_baseline.md`
  - Purpose: Baseline metrics for post-refactoring comparison

## Validation
- [ ] Tests: Current test suite passes without modification
- [ ] Documentation: Complete analysis documents created
- [ ] Baseline: Performance metrics recorded
- [ ] Review: Analysis reviewed and approved by team

## Deliverables
- Current state analysis document
- Performance baseline metrics
- Dependency mapping document
- Identified inconsistencies report
