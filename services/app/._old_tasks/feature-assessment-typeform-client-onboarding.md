# Feature Assessment: TypeForm Client Onboarding Integration

---
feature: typeform-client-onboarding
assessed_date: 2024-12-19
complexity: standard
---

## Feature Overview
**Description**: Integration with TypeForm to allow app users (nutritionists/dietitians) to create client onboarding forms and automatically process responses into the menu planning system.

**Primary Problem**: App users currently gather client information manually and create menus, but client data is never stored in the app. This creates inefficiency and missed opportunities for data-driven menu planning.

**Business Value**: Streamlines client onboarding, stores client data for future AI-powered menu generation, reduces manual data entry, and provides professional form experience.

## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: 
- New bounded context but minimal scope
- External API integration (TypeForm) but straightforward webhook pattern
- Simple integration with existing recipes_catalog context
- User permissions are straightforward (form creator only)
- Minimal changes to existing domain models

## Scope Definition
**In-Scope**:
- New client_onboarding bounded context
- TypeForm API integration for webhook management
- Webhook endpoint for form responses
- Flexible data storage in RDS Postgres
- Simple Client creation in recipes_catalog with form data
- Basic required fields: name, email, phone for client identification

**Out-of-Scope**:
- AI menu generation (future feature)
- Custom form builder
- Advanced TypeForm features (payment, file uploads)
- Complex data validation/transformation
- Multi-user form sharing
- HIPAA compliance requirements (not mentioned as critical)

**Constraints**:
- Only form creator can use their forms
- Minimal changes to existing Client domain model
- Must work with existing DDD/Clean Architecture
- AWS Lambda serverless constraints

## Requirements Profile
**Users**: 
- Primary: Nutritionists/dietitians (app users who create forms)
- Secondary: Potential clients (form respondents)

**Use Cases**:
1. App user creates TypeForm and configures webhook in app
2. App user shares form link with potential clients
3. Client submits form, data is stored and linked to app user
4. App user creates Client in recipes_catalog using stored form data

**Success Criteria**:
- Form responses automatically captured and stored
- Client creation process simplified with pre-filled data
- Flexible storage supports various TypeForm question types
- Zero data loss from form submissions

## Technical Considerations
**Integrations**:
- TypeForm API for webhook configuration
- Existing IAM context for user permissions
- recipes_catalog context for Client creation
- RDS Postgres for flexible data storage

**Performance**: 
- Standard webhook processing (< 30 seconds Lambda timeout)
- Support reasonable form submission volumes

**Security**:
- TypeForm webhook signature verification
- Input validation and sanitization
- User-scoped form access control

**Compliance**: Basic data privacy (store only what's submitted)

## PRD Generation Settings
**Detail Level**: standard
**Target Audience**: Mixed team (senior backend + junior developers)
**Timeline**: Flexible
**Risk Level**: Medium (external API dependency, webhook reliability)
