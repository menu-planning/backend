## Objective
Analyze current test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py structure, identify factory method usage patterns, document existing test coverage, and plan test decomposition strategy.

## Prerequisites
- [x] Access to test file and related factory methods
- [x] Understanding of existing test structure

# Tasks

## 1.1 Current Test Structure Analysis
- [x] 1.1.1 Analyze test file structure and organization
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py`
  - Purpose: Document current test classes and their responsibilities
  - **Completed**: 2,454 lines, 20 test classes, comprehensive organization documented
- [x] 1.1.2 Identify all test classes and their purposes
  - Purpose: Map test organization (BaseApiRecipeTest, TestApiRecipeBasics, etc.)
  - **Completed**: 20 test classes mapped from BaseApiRecipeTest to TestApiRecipeStressAndPerformance
- [x] 1.1.3 Count total lines and test methods
  - Purpose: Establish baseline metrics for refactoring progress
  - **Completed**: 2,454 lines, 86+ test methods, detailed metrics in artifacts

## 1.2 Factory Method Usage Analysis
- [x] 1.2.1 Document factory method dependencies
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/data_factories/api_recipe_data_factories.py`
  - Purpose: Map which factory methods are used and how frequently
  - **Completed**: 70+ factory functions documented, usage patterns mapped in phase_1_factory_dependency_map.json
- [x] 1.2.2 Identify complex factory usage patterns
  - Purpose: Determine which factory calls need explicit data replacement
  - **Completed**: Core, specialized, edge case, and performance factory patterns identified
- [x] 1.2.3 Analyze factory method coupling
  - Purpose: Understand dependencies between factory methods
  - **Completed**: High/medium/low coupling analysis complete, risk assessment documented

## 1.3 Test Coverage Documentation
- [x] 1.3.1 Run coverage analysis on current tests
  - Purpose: Establish baseline coverage metrics
  - **Completed**: 97.1% coverage on target API recipe, 32.82% system-wide, 306 tests passed, 1 failed
- [x] 1.3.2 Document test scenarios covered
  - Purpose: Ensure no scenarios are lost during refactoring
  - **Completed**: Four-layer conversions, computed properties, field validation, collections, performance documented
- [x] 1.3.3 Identify critical test paths
  - Purpose: Prioritize which tests need careful handling
  - **Completed**: Critical scenarios and high-risk areas identified and prioritized

## 1.4 Test Decomposition Strategy
- [x] 1.4.1 Identify complex multi-assertion tests
  - Purpose: Plan how to break down complex tests
  - **Completed**: 4 high-priority decomposition targets identified (error scenario tests)
- [x] 1.4.2 Map test dependencies and order
  - Purpose: Understand test execution flow
  - **Completed**: Fixture dependencies and test execution flow mapped
- [x] 1.4.3 Plan performance test improvements
  - Purpose: Design environment-agnostic performance assertions
  - **Completed**: Performance test enhancement strategy defined for Phase 4

## Validation
- [x] Analysis documentation complete
- [x] Factory usage patterns documented
- [x] Coverage baseline established
- [x] Decomposition strategy defined
- [x] Ready for Phase 2 implementation
