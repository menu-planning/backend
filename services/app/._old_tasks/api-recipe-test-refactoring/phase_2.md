# Phase 2: Factory Method Replacement

---
phase: 2
depends_on: [1]
estimated_time: 3 days
risk_level: medium
---

## Objective
Replace complex factory method calls with explicit test data creation while preserving simple factory usage where beneficial and maintaining test functionality.

## Prerequisites
- [x] Phase 1 analysis complete
- [x] Factory usage patterns documented
- [x] Test coverage baseline established

# Tasks

## 2.1 Simple Factory Replacement
- [x] 2.1.1 Replace basic recipe creation factories
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py`
  - Purpose: Convert simple factory calls to explicit data
  - Completed: Replaced simple_recipe fixture factory call with explicit ApiRecipe creation
- [x] 2.1.2 Create explicit test data for basic scenarios
  - Purpose: Make test data visible and understandable
  - Completed: Replaced simple_recipe, complex_recipe, and minimal edge case with explicit data
- [x] 2.1.3 Validate basic test functionality
  - Purpose: Ensure no functionality loss
  - Completed: Factory replacements maintain same data structure and test compatibility

## 2.2 Complex Factory Replacement
- [x] 2.2.1 Replace complex recipe creation factories
  - Purpose: Convert complex factory calls with explicit ingredient/rating data
  - Completed: Replaced factory calls in test_to_orm_kwargs_error_scenarios and test_computed_properties_with_multiple_ratings
- [x] 2.2.2 Create explicit nested object data
  - Purpose: Make ingredient, rating, and tag data explicit
  - Completed: All remaining factory calls replaced with explicit fixture data
- [x] 2.2.3 Replace collection factory methods
  - Purpose: Convert recipe collection factories to explicit lists
  - Completed: Bulk factory calls in performance tests replaced with fixture-based approaches

## 2.3 Domain Factory Integration
- [x] 2.3.1 Replace domain factory calls where appropriate
  - Purpose: Create explicit domain objects for round-trip tests
  - Completed: Analyzed domain factory usage - determined all current usage is appropriate for domain-to-API conversion testing
- [x] 2.3.2 Maintain domain factory usage for ORM tests
  - Purpose: Keep useful factory methods for complex ORM object creation
  - Completed: Verified ORM factory usage is properly maintained for ORM-to-API conversion tests
- [x] 2.3.3 Update fixture dependencies
  - Purpose: Ensure fixtures work with new explicit data
  - Completed: All fixture dependencies validated and working correctly after factory replacements

## 2.4 Test Data Validation
- [x] 2.4.1 Run tests after each factory replacement
  - Purpose: Validate functionality preservation
  - Completed: 309/309 tests passing (100% success rate) - fixed complex recipe fixture to have 6 ingredients
- [x] 2.4.2 Update test documentation
  - Purpose: Ensure test purposes are clear with explicit data
  - Status: COMPLETED - Comprehensive module-level documentation added explaining factory replacement strategy, test organization, and hybrid approach benefits
- [x] 2.4.3 Verify test data variety
  - Purpose: Ensure edge cases and typical scenarios are covered
  - Status: COMPLETED - Final verification confirms 309/309 tests passing with comprehensive coverage across 21 test classes, 70+ specialized factories preserved, and full edge case coverage maintained

## Validation
- [x] Tests: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py -v`
- [x] Coverage: All tests passing with comprehensive coverage maintained
- [x] All factory replacements tested
- [x] No test functionality lost
