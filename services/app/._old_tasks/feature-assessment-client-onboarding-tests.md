# Feature Assessment: Client Onboarding Test Suite Development

---
feature: client-onboarding-test-suite
assessed_date: 2024-12-28
complexity: standard
---

## Feature Overview
**Description**: Develop comprehensive test suites for the client_onboarding context, mirroring the structure and patterns used in recipes_catalog but tailored for the simpler client onboarding domain
**Primary Problem**: Client onboarding context lacks proper test coverage, making feature development risky and preventing confident refactoring or integration work
**Business Value**: Enables reliable development of client onboarding features, ensures TypeForm integration stability, and provides foundation for future feature development

## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: Multiple components need testing (domain, services, integrations), external API integration requires special handling, and comprehensive test infrastructure needs to be established. However, simpler than recipes_catalog domain and focused scope keeps it from being detailed complexity.

## Scope Definition
**In-Scope**:
- Unit tests for domain entities, commands, and events
- Integration tests for TypeForm API client
- Behavioral tests for webhook processing pipeline
- Test data factories and utilities
- Fake implementations for external services
- Test structure mirroring recipes_catalog patterns

**Out-of-Scope**:
- Integration tests with recipes_catalog context (entity updates pending)
- Performance/load testing
- End-to-end UI testing
- Security penetration testing

**Constraints**:
- Must favor fakes over mocks per team guidelines
- Focus on behavior testing over implementation details
- TypeForm integration is highest priority area
- Follow established patterns from recipes_catalog tests

## Requirements Profile
**Users**: 
- Primary: Backend developers working on client onboarding features
- Secondary: QA engineers, DevOps engineers maintaining CI/CD

**Use Cases**:
- Developer adds new webhook processing logic with confidence
- TypeForm API integration changes are validated automatically
- Domain logic changes are tested for behavioral correctness
- Refactoring is safe with comprehensive test coverage

**Success Criteria**:
- 90%+ test coverage for core domain logic
- All TypeForm API interactions have integration tests
- Webhook processing pipeline fully tested with realistic scenarios
- Test execution time under 30 seconds for full suite
- Zero flaky tests

## Technical Considerations
**Integrations**: TypeForm API, webhook security validation, event publishing system
**Performance**: Test suite should run quickly for developer workflow
**Security**: Webhook signature validation must be thoroughly tested
**Compliance**: No special regulatory requirements
