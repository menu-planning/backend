## Complexity Determination
**Level**: detailed
**Reasoning**: System-wide refactoring across multiple contexts (recipes_catalog, products_catalog, iam) with breaking change potential, multiple dependencies (IAMProvider, MessageBus, UnitOfWork), and requires comprehensive testing strategy. Auto-detection keywords present: "refactor", "migrate", "security", "performance".

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: refactoring
- **Scope**: Both creating new shared components AND modifying existing endpoints across 3 contexts
- **Test Coverage**: Requires comprehensive approach - unit, integration, endpoint, and manual testing

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Breaking changes for API consumers, performance degradation, developer adoption challenges
- **Dependencies**: IAMProvider, MessageBus, UnitOfWork, CORS_headers, Pydantic, anyio
- **Breaking Potential**: High - requires thorough testing and gradual rollout with feature flags

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: detailed
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive (unit/integration/endpoint/manual testing as specified in PRD)
- **Special Considerations**: Maintain backward compatibility, zero breaking changes for existing API consumers

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 3 phases (Foundation, Migration, Testing & Documentation)
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 needed: no (PRD already provides clear structure)
- **Estimated Complexity**: 30 days (as specified in PRD timeline)
