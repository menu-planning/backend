DEPRECATED: This file has been split into focused modules for better maintainability

The tests in this file have been reorganized into the following focused modules:

- test_seedwork_repository_core.py       - Core functionality (filter operators, query methods)
- test_seedwork_repository_joins.py      - Join scenarios and complex filtering  
- test_seedwork_repository_edge_cases.py - Edge cases, error handling, validation
- test_seedwork_repository_behavior.py   - Behavior documentation and examples
- conftest.py                           - Shared fixtures and mock models

Please use the new split files instead of this one.
This file will be removed in a future cleanup.
