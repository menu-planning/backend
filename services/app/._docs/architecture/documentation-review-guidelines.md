# Documentation Review Guidelines

## üéØ Purpose
These guidelines ensure all AI agent onboarding documentation maintains high quality, accuracy, and effectiveness through systematic review processes. Use these standards for reviewing documentation changes, new content, and periodic audits.

## üìã Review Types and Scope

### 1. Content Reviews (New Documentation)
**Scope**: New documentation files, major sections, or significant content additions
**Timeline**: 2-3 business days
**Reviewers**: 2+ reviewers (1 technical, 1 documentation expert)

### 2. Change Reviews (Updates and Fixes)
**Scope**: Updates to existing content, bug fixes, example corrections
**Timeline**: 1-2 business days  
**Reviewers**: 1+ reviewer (domain expert)

### 3. Periodic Audits (Maintenance Reviews)
**Scope**: Comprehensive review of entire documentation sections
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Reviewers**: Documentation team + domain experts

### 4. Emergency Reviews (Hotfixes)
**Scope**: Critical fixes that must be deployed immediately
**Timeline**: ‚â§4 hours
**Reviewers**: 1 senior reviewer + automated validation
