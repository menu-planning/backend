# Cold Start Test Results

## Test Overview
This document records the actual experience of simulating an AI agent "cold start" using only the available documentation to complete onboarding scenarios. Each test was conducted with no prior codebase knowledge, relying solely on the documentation.

**Test Date**: Current Session  
**Tester Role**: Simulated AI Agent (Fresh Start)

**Experience**:
1. **Pattern Selection** (3 minutes): ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Found "Adding a New Command" pattern - not quite right for simple property
   - Better: Would need "Domain Property Addition" pattern (not found)
   - Used cached property pattern as closest match
   
2. **Domain Event Consideration** (4 minutes): ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Pattern library showed domain event examples
   - Decision tree helped: "Does this change affect other aggregates?" ‚Üí No
   - Conclusion: Simple property, no events needed
   
3. **Testing Approach** (2 minutes): ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Found test strategy selection in decision trees
   - Unit tests recommended for domain properties
   - Pattern library provided test examples

**Actual Time**: 9 minutes ‚úÖ UNDER TARGET  
**Issues Found**: 
- Missing "Simple Domain Property Addition" pattern
- Had to infer from more complex patterns

**Documentation Effectiveness**: Good, but gap identified

**Scenario 1 Total Time**: 25 minutes ‚úÖ SUCCESS (Target: 30 minutes)

---

## Scenario 2: "Performance Concern" - Optimization Task
**Target Time**: 30 minutes total

### Task 2.1: Problem Analysis (Target: 10 minutes)
**Problem**: "Recipe search is slow with large datasets"

**Documentation Used**: `docs/architecture/troubleshooting-guide.md`

**Experience**:
1. **Performance Investigation** (4 minutes): ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Troubleshooting guide had dedicated "Performance Issues" section
   - Clear diagnostic steps: "Is it database query related?"
   - BenchmarkTimer usage examples provided
   
2. **Bottleneck Identification** (5 minutes): ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Guide suggested checking repository vs QueryBuilder usage
   - Technical specifications provided query comparison examples
   - Identified likely repository caching issue

**Actual Time**: 9 minutes ‚úÖ UNDER TARGET

### Task 2.2: Solution Selection (Target: 10 minutes)

**Documentation Used**: `docs/architecture/decision-trees.md` - "Should I Cache This?"

**Experience**:
1. **Caching Decision** (6 minutes): ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Decision flowchart was comprehensive and easy to follow
   - "Is it frequently accessed?" ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí "Is data relatively stable?" ‚Üí Yes
   - Clear recommendation: Repository-level caching with @cached_property
   
2. **Performance Planning** (3 minutes): ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Technical specifications provided BenchmarkTimer examples
   - Clear before/after measurement approach outlined

**Actual Time**: 9 minutes ‚úÖ UNDER TARGET

### Task 2.3: Implementation Planning (Target: 10 minutes)

**Documentation Used**: `docs/architecture/pattern-library.md` - Cached property patterns

**Experience**:
1. **Pattern Application** (6 minutes): ‚úÖ SUCCESS
   - Found "Implementing a Cached Property" section
