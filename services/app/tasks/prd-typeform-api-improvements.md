## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The current Typeform API integration in the client onboarding context contains critical security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps that prevent production deployment. The webhook signature verification is incomplete (placeholder implementation), rate limiting is misconfigured, and webhook management lacks automation, creating security risks and operational inefficiencies.

### Proposed Solution
Implement complete HMAC-SHA256 webhook signature verification following Typeform's official documentation, automate webhook management via Typeform's API endpoints, correct rate limiting configuration, and establish production-ready webhook retry logic with comprehensive error handling.

### Business Value
- **Security**: Eliminates critical webhook security vulnerabilities
- **Compliance**: Achieves full adherence to Typeform API documentation
- **Reliability**: Enables 99%+ webhook delivery reliability for client onboarding
- **Automation**: Reduces manual webhook management overhead
- **Production Readiness**: Unblocks secure production deployment

### Success Criteria
- 100% webhook signature verification implementation matching Typeform docs
- Zero security vulnerabilities in webhook handling
- Automated webhook management with 99%+ reliability
- Proper rate limiting compliance (2 req/sec)
- Production-ready retry logic handling all documented failure scenarios

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
1. **CRITICAL**: Implement complete HMAC-SHA256 webhook signature verification with base64 encoding and trailing newline handling
2. **ESSENTIAL**: Add webhook management automation via Typeform's webhook endpoints (PUT /forms/{id}/webhooks/{tag})
3. **REQUIRED**: Fix rate limiting configuration from 4 req/sec to 2 req/sec to match Typeform's documented limit
4. **IMPORTANT**: Implement production-ready webhook retry logic with 2-3 minute intervals for 10 hours
5. **NECESSARY**: Enhance error handling for webhook delivery failures using existing exception patterns

### Non-Goals
1. UI/frontend changes for webhook management interfaces
2. Database schema modifications or migrations
3. Support for new webhook event types beyond form_response
4. Performance optimization beyond rate limiting compliance
5. Migration of existing webhook configurations

## User Stories

- [ ] Signature verification handles trailing newline correctly
- [ ] Invalid signatures are rejected with appropriate error responses
- [ ] Security events are logged for audit purposes

### Story 2: Automated Webhook Management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Webhook creation via Typeform's PUT /forms/{id}/webhooks/{tag} endpoint
- [ ] Webhook updates and deletions are automated
- [ ] Webhook status monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Error handling for webhook management failures

### Story 3: Reliable Webhook Delivery
**As a** client onboarding administrator **I want** webhook delivery to be reliable **So that** no form responses are lost and the system handles failures gracefully

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Retry logic with 2-3 minute intervals for 10 hours total
- [ ] Immediate disable for 410/404 responses

### Data Model
Current webhook handler structure maintained with enhanced security:
- `WebhookHandler` class with complete signature verification
- `TypeFormClient` with webhook management methods
- Enhanced error handling using existing exception patterns

### API Specifications
**Webhook Signature Verification**:
```python
def verify_webhook_signature(payload: str, signature: str, secret: str) -> bool:
    # payload + '\n' → HMAC-SHA256 → base64 encode → 'sha256=' prefix
    expected = 'sha256=' + base64.b64encode(
        hmac.new(secret.encode(), (payload + '\n').encode(), hashlib.sha256).digest()
    ).decode()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)
```

**Webhook Management Endpoints**:
- `PUT /forms/{form_id}/webhooks/{tag}` - Create/update webhook
- `GET /forms/{form_id}/webhooks/{tag}` - Get webhook details
- `DELETE /forms/{form_id}/webhooks/{tag}` - Delete webhook

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Complete Webhook Signature Verification
