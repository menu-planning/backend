## Feature Overview
**Description**: Critical security and compliance improvements to the existing Typeform API integration within the client onboarding context
**Primary Problem**: Incomplete webhook security implementation and API integration gaps that pose security risks and prevent production deployment
**Business Value**: Enables secure, production-ready client onboarding automation with full Typeform API compliance

## Complexity Determination
**Level**: detailed
**Reasoning**: Critical security vulnerabilities, system-wide integration changes, compliance requirements with third-party API documentation, and production-ready webhook handling requirements

## Scope Definition
**In-Scope**: 
- Complete HMAC-SHA256 webhook signature verification with base64 encoding and trailing newline handling
- Webhook management automation via Typeform's webhook management endpoints
- Rate limiting configuration correction (4 req/sec â†’ 2 req/sec)
- Production-ready webhook retry logic with proper failure handling
- Enhanced error handling for webhook delivery failures

**Out-of-Scope**: 
- UI/frontend changes for webhook management
- Database schema modifications
- New webhook event types beyond form_response
- Performance optimization beyond rate limiting compliance
- Migration of existing webhook configurations

**Constraints**: 
- Must maintain existing clean architecture patterns
- Cannot break existing webhook processing functionality
- Must comply with Typeform's official API documentation
- Security implementation must be production-ready

## Requirements Profile
**Users**: 
- Primary: Backend developers implementing webhook security
- Secondary: DevOps engineers deploying webhook handlers
- Tertiary: Client onboarding administrators monitoring webhook reliability

**Use Cases**: 
- Secure webhook signature verification for incoming Typeform responses
- Automated webhook setup for new client onboarding forms
- Reliable webhook delivery with proper retry mechanics
- Production monitoring of webhook failures and rate limiting

**Success Criteria**: 
- 100% webhook signature verification implementation matching Typeform docs
- Zero security vulnerabilities in webhook handling
- Automated webhook management with 99%+ reliability
- Proper rate limiting compliance (2 req/sec)
- Production-ready retry logic handling all documented failure scenarios

## Technical Considerations
**Integrations**: 
- Typeform API webhook management endpoints (PUT /forms/{id}/webhooks/{tag})
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification system
- Rate limiting middleware integration
- Error handling and monitoring systems

**Performance**: 
- Rate limiting compliance: 2 requests/second maximum
- Webhook processing latency targets: <2 seconds
- Retry logic efficiency with exponential backoff

**Security**: 
- CRITICAL: Complete HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- Secure webhook secret management
- Protection against replay attacks
- Audit logging for all security events

**Compliance**: 
- Full adherence to Typeform API documentation
- Webhook retry policy compliance (2-3 min intervals, 10 hours total)
- Proper handling of webhook disable conditions (410/404 responses)

## PRD Generation Settings
