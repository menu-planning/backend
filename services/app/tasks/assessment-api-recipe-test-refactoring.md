## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: This is a test refactoring project targeting a single comprehensive test file with 2000+ lines. While the scope is limited to one file, the complexity involves replacing factory methods with explicit data, breaking down complex tests, and implementing environment-agnostic performance assertions across multiple test classes.

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: refactoring
- **Scope**: single file modification (test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py)
- **Test Coverage**: comprehensive existing coverage with factory-heavy patterns
- **File Size**: 2000+ lines with multiple test classes and extensive factory usage

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Test functionality loss during refactoring, performance test instability
- **Dependencies**: External factory methods, pytest framework, existing test utilities
- **Breaking Potential**: Medium - could break existing test execution if not carefully managed

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: standard
- **Testing Strategy**: refactor existing tests while maintaining coverage
- **Special Considerations**: strict constraint against production code changes, must maintain test coverage

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 5 phases as outlined in PRD
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 needed: no (analysis integrated into Phase 1)
- **Estimated Complexity**: 12 days as specified in PRD timeline

## Next Step
Ready for task structure generation with standard complexity level focusing on systematic refactoring approach.
