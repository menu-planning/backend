## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: Multiple test classes creation, comprehensive field validation, domain layer integration, error handling scenarios, and 100% coverage goals fit standard complexity profile

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: new feature (test suite creation)
- **Scope**: creating new test components for ApiCreateRecipe class validation
- **Test Coverage**: currently lacking, goal is 100% coverage of ApiCreateRecipe functionality

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: complex nested objects (ingredients, tags, nutri_facts) may have edge cases, field validation complexity across different types
- **Dependencies**: CreateRecipe domain command class, Pydantic validation system, recipe field validation classes
- **Breaking Potential**: low (test-only changes, no production code modification)

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: standard
- **Testing Strategy**: comprehensive unit and integration testing approach with focus on field validation and domain conversion
- **Special Considerations**: create comprehensive test fixtures covering all ingredient and tag combinations

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 3 phases (Core Field Validation, Domain Conversion & Complex Fields, Error Handling & Integration)
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 needed: no
- **Estimated Complexity**: 2-3 days
