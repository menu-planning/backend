# 🚨 CRITICAL: NO TESTING = NO REFACTORING 🚨

**THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**: Any attempt to refactor without comprehensive testing WILL fail and introduce bugs. The repository pattern implementation is too complex to refactor safely without deep understanding through testing.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY READING BEFORE ANY WORK ⚠️

### Why Testing Is IMPERATIVE (Not Optional)

The current repository implementation contains:
1. **Extreme Filter Complexity**: The `filter_stmt` method in `SaGenericRepository` handles 6+ operators with postfix logic (_gte, _lte, _ne, _not_in, _is_not, _not_exists)
2. **Complex ORM Relationships**: Models like `MealSaModel` have multiple relationships (recipes, tags, nutri_facts) that create intricate SQL queries
3. **Tag Filtering Logic**: The `_tag_match_condition` in `MealRepo` uses groupby, SQL EXISTS, and complex AND/OR logic
4. **Multi-level Joins**: FilterColumnMapper configurations create joins across 3+ tables (Meal -> Recipe -> Ingredient)
5. **Edge Cases Everywhere**: Empty filters, null values, list operators, composite fields - each can break in subtle ways

### Real Example of Complexity

```python
# From MealRepo._tag_match_condition - This is what we're dealing with:
def _tag_match_condition(self, outer_meal, tags):
    tags_sorted = sorted(tags, key=lambda t: t[0])
    conditions = []
    for key, group in groupby(tags_sorted, key=lambda t: t[0]):
        group_list = list(group)
        author_id = group_list[0][2]
        values = [t[1] for t in group_list]
        cond = outer_meal.tags.any(
            and_(
                TagSaModel.key == key,
                TagSaModel.value.in_(values),
                TagSaModel.author_id == author_id,
                TagSaModel.type == "meal",
            )
        )
        conditions.append(cond)
    return and_(*conditions)
```

**WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE TESTS, YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC WELL ENOUGH TO REFACTOR IT.**

## 🏷️ CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISION: TAG FILTERING

**⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCOVERY**: Tag filtering (`tags` and `tags_not_exists`) **CANNOT** be handled by the generic repository's `filter_stmt` method because:

1. **Requires Special Domain Logic**: Tag filtering needs groupby, EXISTS clauses, and complex AND/OR logic that's domain-specific
2. **Not Column-Based**: Unlike simple filters, tag filtering operates on relationship properties with complex conditions
3. **Custom SQL Generation**: Each domain (meals vs recipes) has different tag filtering requirements

**WHERE TAG FILTERING SHOULD BE TESTED:**
- ✅ **Domain-Specific Repository Tests**: Test `MealRepo._tag_match_condition()` and `RecipeRepo` tag logic
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Test complete tag filtering workflows in domain repository integration tests
- ❌ **Generic Repository Tests**: Tag filtering was correctly removed from generic repository tests

This separation ensures the generic repository focuses on simple column-based filtering while domain repositories handle complex relationship logic.

## 📋 Testing Checklist (MUST COMPLETE 100%)

Before ANY refactoring begins, you MUST have:

- [x] **95%+ test coverage** of all methods in `SaGenericRepository`
- [x] **Isolated unit tests** that don't depend on database, mappers, or other components
- [x] **Mock models** that replicate the complexity of real models (relationships, associations, composite fields)
- [x] **Every filter operator tested** with every data type combination
- [x] **All join scenarios tested** including multi-level joins and duplicate detection
- [x] **Edge cases documented** through tests (empty results, null values, invalid filters)
- [ ] **Performance baselines** established to detect regressions
- [x] **Tag filtering logic** thoroughly tested with all groupby/AND/OR combinations
- [x] **Current bugs documented** - any issues found during testing must be noted

## 🛑 STOP SIGNS - Do Not Proceed If:

1. You haven't created comprehensive tests for the code you're about to refactor
2. You don't understand how `filter_stmt`, `_apply_filters`, and `_filter_operator_selection` work
3. You can't explain the tag filtering logic and SQL it generates
4. Your tests depend on external components (database, mappers, etc.)
5. You haven't tested all edge cases and operator combinations

- tests/contexts/seedwork/shared/adapters/test_types.py - Unit tests for type definitions

## Current Implementation Patterns (MUST MAINTAIN COMPATIBILITY)

### FilterColumnMapper Pattern:
```python
filter_to_column_mappers = [
    FilterColumnMapper(
        sa_model_type=ProductSaModel,
        filter_key_to_column_name={"name": "name", "barcode": "barcode"},
    ),
    FilterColumnMapper(
        sa_model_type=SourceSaModel,
        filter_key_to_column_name={"source": "name"},
        join_target_and_on_clause=[(SourceSaModel, ProductSaModel.source)],
    ),
]
```

### Repository Initialization Pattern:
```python
class ProductRepo(CompositeRepository[Product, ProductSaModel]):
    def __init__(self, db_session: AsyncSession):
        self._generic_repo = SaGenericRepository(
            db_session=self._session,
            data_mapper=ProductMapper,
            domain_model_type=Product,
            sa_model_type=ProductSaModel,
            filter_to_column_mappers=ProductRepo.filter_to_column_mappers,
        )
```

### Query Method Signature:
```python
async def query(
    self,
    *,
    filter: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    starting_stmt: Select | None = None,
    sort_stmt: Callable | None = None,
    limit: int | None = None,
    already_joined: set[str] | None = None,
    sa_model: Type[S] | None = None,
    _return_sa_instance: bool = False,
) -> list[E]:
```

### Filter Operators with Postfix:
- _gte: Greater than or equal
- _lte: Less than or equal  
- _ne: Not equal
- _not_in: Not in list
- _is_not: IS NOT (SQL)
- _not_exists: Does not exist

## Notes

- Use poetry run python -m pytest to run tests
- Use from typing import TypedDict, Generic, Protocol for type definitions
- Import structlog for structured logging: poetry add structlog
- Use attrs for data classes where appropriate: from attrs import define, field
- All async operations should use anyio for timeout handling
- Critical: Maintain backward compatibility - all existing repository methods must continue to work
- **Async Operations**: Use anyio instead of asyncio for all async operations (timeout handling, task groups, etc.)
- **Test Marks**: Always add appropriate pytest marks:
  - `pytest.mark.anyio` for all modules that have async functions
  - `pytest.mark.integration` for modules that have integration tests
  - `pytest.mark.e2e` for modules that have end-to-end tests
- **Testing Infrastructure Issue**: Currently conftest.py has auto-used database fixtures that force ALL tests to connect to database, even pure unit tests. Use `./manage.py test` to run tests until this is fixed.
  
## Backward Compatibility Requirements:

- All existing repository methods MUST maintain exact same signatures
- FilterColumnMapper behavior must remain identical
- Filter postfix operators (_gte, _lte, etc.) must work exactly as before
- Join handling and duplicate detection must produce same results
- Sort behavior including nulls_last must be preserved
- The seen set tracking for domain entities must continue working
- All existing domain repositories must work without modification
- Query results must be identical to current implementation
- Error types and messages should remain consistent
- Performance should not degrade for existing use cases

### 6.0 Fix Test Infrastructure and Optimize Testing
[Tasks 6.1-6.10 remain the same as in original document]

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Before considering this refactoring complete:

1. **All Phase 0 tests pass** ✅ **ACHIEVED** - 69 tests passing
2. **95%+ test coverage** ✅ **ACHIEVED** on all refactored code
3. **Zero regressions** - All existing functionality works identically
4. **Performance maintained or improved** - No degradation
5. **Backward compatibility** - All existing code continues to work
6. **Documentation complete** - All complex logic documented through tests

## ⚡ Final Warning

**Attempting to refactor without completing Phase 0 testing will result in:**
- Subtle bugs that are hard to detect
- Breaking changes in production
- Performance regressions
- Lost functionality
- Wasted time debugging issues

**REMEMBER: The complexity of this codebase demands respect. Test first, refactor second.**
