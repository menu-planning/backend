## Complexity Determination
**Level**: detailed
**Reasoning**: Security-critical webhook signature verification, core system changes across multiple components, production compliance requirements, and integration with existing architecture patterns require comprehensive task breakdown with detailed security testing.

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: Security enhancement with critical infrastructure improvements
- **Scope**: Modifying existing webhook handler, TypeForm client, and configuration components
- **Test Coverage**: High coverage required (95%+) for security-critical code paths

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: HMAC signature implementation complexity, rate limiting edge cases, retry logic complexity
- **Dependencies**: Existing TypeFormClient patterns, webhook payload validation, exception handling framework
- **Breaking Potential**: Medium - Could affect existing webhook processing if not implemented carefully

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: detailed (security requirements demand comprehensive guidance)
- **Testing Strategy**: Security-focused testing with unit, integration, and penetration testing
- **Special Considerations**: Production-ready security implementation, compliance with Typeform API documentation

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 4 phases matching PRD implementation plan
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 not needed - existing architecture is solid foundation
- **Estimated Complexity**: 14 days total (12 implementation + 2 risk buffer)
