## Objective
Replace fixed-time performance assertions with environment-agnostic relative performance measurements and implement regression detection mechanisms.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Recipe and meal tests refactored
- [ ] Performance helpers validated
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics established
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Review `analysis/performance_test_bottlenecks.md` for specific performance issues**

# Tasks

## 3.1 Relative Performance Implementation
- [ ] 3.1.1 Replace fixed-time assertions in recipe tests
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py`
  - Purpose: Use relative performance comparisons instead of absolute time limits
- [ ] 3.1.2 Replace fixed-time assertions in meal tests
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/test_api_meal_performance.py`
  - Purpose: Implement environment-agnostic performance testing
- [ ] 3.1.3 Create baseline performance benchmarks
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/performance_test_helpers.py`
  - Purpose: Establish reference performance metrics

## 3.2 Environment-Agnostic Thresholds
- [ ] 3.2.1 Implement adaptive performance baselines
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/performance_test_helpers.py`
  - Purpose: Dynamic performance limits based on environment capabilities
- [ ] 3.2.2 Create performance regression detection
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/performance_test_helpers.py`
  - Purpose: Detect performance degradation across test runs
- [ ] 3.2.3 Add performance test stability measures
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/performance_test_helpers.py`
  - Purpose: Ensure consistent performance test outcomes

## 3.3 Performance Test Optimization
- [ ] 3.3.1 Optimize performance test execution
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py`, `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/test_api_meal_performance.py`
  - Purpose: Reduce performance test execution time
- [ ] 3.3.2 Implement efficient test data generation
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/test_data_constants.py`
  - Purpose: Optimize test data creation for performance tests
- [ ] 3.3.3 Create performance test reporting
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/performance_test_helpers.py`
  - Purpose: Generate detailed performance test reports

## 3.4 Cross-Environment Validation
- [ ] 3.4.1 Validate performance tests across environments
  - Files: Local test environments
  - Purpose: Ensure 100% performance test reliability
- [ ] 3.4.2 Create performance test monitoring
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/performance_test_helpers.py`
  - Purpose: Track performance test stability over time
- [ ] 3.4.3 Implement performance test fallback mechanisms
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/performance_test_helpers.py`
  - Purpose: Graceful handling of performance test failures

## Validation
- [ ] Performance: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/ -v --tb=short`
- [ ] Cross-environment: Run tests on 3 different local environments (if available)
- [ ] Regression: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/ --benchmark-compare`
- [ ] Stability: Run performance tests 10 times to validate consistency
- [ ] Lint: `poetry run python -m ruff check tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/`

## Success Criteria
- 100% performance test reliability across 5 environments
- Performance tests complete in 50% less time
- Zero false positives in performance test failures
- Performance regression detection working
- Adaptive baselines responding correctly to environment changes
