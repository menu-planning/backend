## Feature Overview
**Description**: Standardize AWS Lambda endpoint implementations across all contexts (recipes_catalog, products_catalog, iam) to create consistent patterns for authorization, error handling, logging, request/response processing, and validation.

**Primary Problem**: Current endpoints have inconsistent implementations with varying error handling patterns, body parsing approaches, logging levels, authorization flows, and response formats, making the codebase harder to maintain and extend.

**Business Value**: Improved developer productivity, reduced bugs, easier onboarding, better monitoring/debugging capabilities, and a solid foundation for future state-of-the-art implementations.

## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: System-wide refactoring across multiple contexts, but focused on infrastructure patterns rather than domain logic. MVP approach with extensible design for future enhancements.

## Scope Definition
**In-Scope**: 
- Standardized endpoint structure and patterns
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- Unified logging approach with proper correlation IDs
- Standardized authorization flow and permission checking
- Request validation and body parsing consistency
- Pydantic TypeAdapters for collection endpoints
- Reusable middleware/decorator patterns
- Documentation of patterns for future implementations

**Out-of-Scope**: 
- Domain logic modifications
- Database schema changes
- Frontend integration updates
- Performance optimizations (beyond basic logging)
- Advanced security features (keep simple for MVP)
- Comprehensive testing framework overhaul

**Constraints**: 
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Keep security relevant but simple for MVP
- Design for future state-of-the-art implementations
- No domain logic changes

## Requirements Profile
**Users**: 
- Primary: Backend developers working on the codebase
- Secondary: DevOps team for monitoring/debugging
- Tertiary: API consumers (indirect benefit through consistency)

**Use Cases**: 
- Developer adds new endpoint following consistent patterns
- Error debugging through standardized logging
- Authorization enforcement across all endpoints
- API response processing by consumers

**Success Criteria**: 
- All endpoints follow same structural pattern
- Consistent error messages and status codes
- Unified logging format across contexts
- Authorization code reuse >=80%
- New endpoint development time reduced by 30%

## Technical Considerations
**Integrations**: IAM provider, MessageBus, UnitOfWork patterns across contexts
**Performance**: Standardized logging without performance degradation
**Security**: Simple but consistent authorization patterns, proper error message sanitization
**Compliance**: User permission checking, data access logging
