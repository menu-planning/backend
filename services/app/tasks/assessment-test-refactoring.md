## Complexity Determination
**Level**: detailed
**Reasoning**: System-wide refactoring affecting multiple test files, performance-critical changes, high risk of breaking existing functionality, requires comprehensive testing strategy

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: refactoring
- **Scope**: existing code modification across multiple test files
- **Test Coverage**: maintaining 95%+ coverage while refactoring the test infrastructure itself

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Performance test instability, test coverage regression, CI/CD pipeline disruption
- **Dependencies**: Factory methods, test infrastructure, external test utilities
- **Breaking Potential**: High - could break existing test infrastructure and CI/CD reliability

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: detailed
- **Testing Strategy**: comprehensive with environment-agnostic performance testing
- **Special Considerations**: Must maintain 100% test reliability, reduce execution time by 25%

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 5 phases (Phase 0: Foundation, Phase 1-4: Implementation)
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 needed: yes
- **Estimated Complexity**: 6-8 weeks range
