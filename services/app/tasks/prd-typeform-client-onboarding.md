# PRD: TypeForm Client Onboarding Integration

---
feature: typeform-client-onboarding
complexity: standard
created: 2024-12-19
version: 1.0
---

## Overview
**Problem**: App users (nutritionists/dietitians) currently gather client information manually and create menus, but client data is never stored in the app. This creates inefficiency and missed opportunities for data-driven menu planning.

**Solution**: Integrate with TypeForm to allow app users to create professional onboarding forms, automatically capture client responses via webhooks, and store flexible client data for future menu generation.

**Value**: Streamlines client onboarding process, reduces manual data entry, provides professional form experience, and enables future AI-powered menu customization using stored client data.

## Goals & Scope
### Goals
1. Enable app users to create and manage TypeForm-based client onboarding forms
2. Automatically capture and store client form responses with flexible data structure
3. Integrate stored data with recipes_catalog for simplified Client creation
4. Prepare foundation for future AI-driven menu personalization

### Out of Scope
1. AI menu generation (future feature)
2. Custom form builder within the app
3. Advanced TypeForm features (payments, file uploads, conditional logic)
4. Multi-user form sharing
5. HIPAA compliance requirements
6. Complex data validation or transformation

## User Stories
### Story 1: Form Creation and Configuration
**As a** nutritionist **I want** to paste my TypeForm link into the app **So that** I can automatically receive client onboarding responses

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] App extracts TypeForm ID from shareable link
- [ ] App configures webhook with TypeForm API automatically
- [ ] App validates TypeForm ownership/access permissions
- [ ] App provides confirmation of successful webhook setup

### Story 2: Client Response Processing
**As a** nutritionist **I want** client form submissions to be automatically stored **So that** I can create personalized menus with their information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Webhook receives TypeForm responses in real-time
- [ ] System extracts required fields (name, email, phone) for client identification
- [ ] System stores flexible response data supporting various question types
- [ ] System links responses to the form creator (app user)
- [ ] System handles webhook signature verification for security

### Story 3: Client Creation Integration
**As a** nutritionist **I want** to create Clients using stored form data **So that** I can quickly onboard clients with pre-filled information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] recipes_catalog can access stored form responses
- [ ] Client creation pre-fills Profile, ContactInfo, and Address from form data
- [ ] Additional form data is stored in new Client field for future use
- [ ] Client creation process remains backward compatible

## Technical Requirements
### Architecture
New `client_onboarding` bounded context with:
- **Domain**: OnboardingForm, FormResponse entities
- **Infrastructure**: TypeForm API client, webhook handler
- **Application**: Form configuration, response processing services
- **Integration**: recipes_catalog context integration points

### Data Requirements
**OnboardingForm Table:**
- `id`, `user_id`, `typeform_id`, `webhook_url`, `created_at`, `status`

**FormResponse Table:**
- `id`, `form_id`, `response_data` (JSONB), `client_identifiers` (name, email, phone), `processed_at`, `created_at`

**Client Model Addition:**
- New field: `onboarding_data` (JSONB) for storing original form responses

### Integration Points
1. **TypeForm API**: Webhook configuration, form validation
2. **IAM Context**: User authentication and authorization
3. **recipes_catalog Context**: Client creation with form data
4. **RDS Postgres**: Flexible JSONB storage for form responses

## Functional Requirements
1. **Form Link Processing**: Extract TypeForm ID from shareable URLs, validate access
2. **Webhook Management**: Configure TypeForm webhooks via API, handle webhook lifecycle
3. **Response Processing**: Receive webhooks, verify signatures, extract client identifiers
4. **Data Storage**: Store responses with flexible schema supporting various question types
5. **Client Integration**: Enable Client creation with pre-filled form data
6. **User Permissions**: Restrict form access to creator only

## Quality Requirements
- **Performance**: Webhook processing under 10 seconds, support up to 100 forms per user
- **Security**: TypeForm webhook signature verification, input sanitization, user-scoped access
- **Reliability**: Webhook retry logic, graceful degradation if TypeForm unavailable
- **Scalability**: JSONB storage for flexible form structures, efficient querying

## Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Domain logic, data validation, TypeForm API client
- **Integration Tests**: Webhook processing, database operations, recipes_catalog integration
- **Manual Testing**: End-to-end form creation and client onboarding workflow
- **Security Testing**: Webhook signature verification, input validation

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Core TypeForm Integration (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Create client_onboarding bounded context structure
- [ ] Implement TypeForm API client for webhook configuration
- [ ] Build webhook endpoint with signature verification
- [ ] Create database schema and repositories

### Phase 2: Data Processing & Storage (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Implement flexible response data processing
- [ ] Add client identifier extraction logic
- [ ] Create form response storage with JSONB
- [ ] Build user permission controls

### Phase 3: recipes_catalog Integration (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Add onboarding_data field to Client entity
- [ ] Implement Client creation with form data pre-filling
- [ ] Create integration service between contexts
- [ ] Add backward compatibility validation

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 4)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Documentation and deployment

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 80% of active users create at least one onboarding form
- **Efficiency**: 50% reduction in client creation time using form data
- **Data Quality**: 95% of form responses successfully processed and stored
- **Reliability**: 99% webhook processing success rate

## Risks & Mitigation
- **TypeForm API Changes**: Monitor API versions, implement adapter pattern
- **Webhook Reliability**: Implement retry logic and manual backup processing
- **Data Schema Evolution**: Use JSONB for flexibility, versioning strategy
- **Performance Impact**: Async processing, database indexing, monitoring

## Dependencies
- **External**: TypeForm API access and webhook capabilities
- **Internal**: IAM context for user management, recipes_catalog for Client creation
- **Infrastructure**: RDS Postgres with JSONB support, AWS Lambda for webhooks

## Timeline
- **Total Estimated**: 4 weeks
- **Phase 1-2**: Core integration (2 weeks)
- **Phase 3-4**: Integration and testing (2 weeks)
