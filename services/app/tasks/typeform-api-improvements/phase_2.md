# Phase 2: API Integration and Configuration

---
phase: 2
depends_on: [phase_1]
estimated_time: 24 hours (3 days)
risk_level: medium
priority: P1 - Essential for Operations
---

## Objective
Extend TypeFormClient with automated webhook management capabilities, correct rate limiting configuration to comply with Typeform's API limits, and enhance error handling for webhook operations.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase 1 complete (security implementation functional)
- [ ] TYPEFORM_API_KEY environment variable configured
- [ ] Existing TypeFormClient patterns understood (lines 330-441)

# Tasks

## 2.1 Webhook Management Automation
- [x] 2.1.1 Enhance webhook creation methods
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/typeform_client.py`
  - Purpose: Extend existing create_webhook method (lines 330-370) with automation
- [x] 2.1.2 Add webhook health monitoring
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/typeform_client.py`
  - Purpose: Add health check capabilities to webhook management
- [x] 2.1.3 Implement automated webhook setup service
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_manager.py`
  - Purpose: Create high-level service for webhook lifecycle management
  - Completed: Comprehensive automated webhook service already implemented with database integration
- [x] 2.1.4 Add webhook status tracking
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_manager.py`
  - Purpose: Track webhook creation, updates, and deletion operations
  - Completed: Added WebhookStatusInfo, WebhookOperationRecord, comprehensive status tracking, bulk checking, and operation history

## 2.2 Rate Limiting Configuration Fix
- [x] 2.2.1 Update rate limiting configuration
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/config.py`
  - Purpose: Change line 18 from 4 req/sec to 2 req/sec for Typeform compliance
  - Completed: Updated typeform_rate_limit_requests_per_second from 4 to 2
- [x] 2.2.2 Add rate limit validation
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/typeform_client.py`
  - Purpose: Validate rate limit compliance in HTTP client configuration
  - Completed: Implemented comprehensive RateLimitValidator class with enforcement, monitoring, and compliance validation
- [x] 2.2.3 Implement rate limit monitoring
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/typeform_client.py`
  - Purpose: Add monitoring for rate limit usage and compliance
  - Completed: Comprehensive rate limit monitoring implemented with real-time metrics, compliance checking, and status reporting

## 2.3 Enhanced Error Handling for Webhook Operations
- [x] 2.3.1 Add webhook management exceptions
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/exceptions.py`
  - Purpose: Extend existing webhook exceptions (lines 51-73) for management operations
  - Completed: Comprehensive webhook management exceptions already implemented (lines 75-153)
- [x] 2.3.2 Implement webhook operation error handling
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_manager.py`
  - Purpose: Handle failures in webhook CRUD operations gracefully
  - Completed: Error handling implemented throughout with proper rollback, exception raising, and operation tracking
- [x] 2.3.3 Add webhook management logging
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_manager.py`
  - Purpose: Log webhook management operations for debugging
  - Completed: Comprehensive logging implemented with 28+ statements covering all operations (info, error, warning, debug levels)

## 2.4 Integration Testing Setup
- [ ] 2.4.1 Create webhook management integration tests
  - Files: `tests/contexts/client_onboarding/integration/test_webhook_management.py` (NEW)
  - Purpose: Test automated webhook setup and teardown
- [ ] 2.4.2 Add rate limiting compliance tests
  - Files: `tests/contexts/client_onboarding/services/test_typeform_client.py`
  - Purpose: Verify rate limiting configuration and behavior
- [ ] 2.4.3 Create webhook lifecycle tests
  - Files: `tests/contexts/client_onboarding/services/test_webhook_manager.py` (NEW)
  - Purpose: Test complete webhook lifecycle management

## 2.5 Configuration Validation
- [ ] 2.5.1 Add configuration validation
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/config.py`
  - Purpose: Validate rate limiting and webhook configuration on startup
- [ ] 2.5.2 Update container configuration
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/core/bootstrap/container.py`
  - Purpose: Update webhook_manager factory (lines 37-40) with new capabilities

## Validation
- [ ] Integration Tests: `poetry run python pytest tests/contexts/client_onboarding/integration/test_webhook_management.py -v`
- [ ] Client Tests: `poetry run python pytest tests/contexts/client_onboarding/services/test_typeform_client.py -v`
- [ ] Manager Tests: `poetry run python pytest tests/contexts/client_onboarding/services/test_webhook_manager.py -v`
- [ ] Configuration Test: Verify rate limiting at 2 req/sec
- [ ] Webhook Creation Test: Automated webhook setup with live Typeform API (if available)
- [ ] Lint: `poetry run python ruff check src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/`
- [ ] Type: `poetry run python mypy src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_manager.py`

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All webhook management operations automated
- [ ] Rate limiting corrected and validated
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests passing with mock Typeform API
- [ ] Configuration validation prevents misconfigurations

## Dependencies for Next Phase
- Automated webhook management functional
- Rate limiting properly configured
- Enhanced error handling for operations
