# Phase 3: Reliability & Retry Logic

---
phase: 3
depends_on: [phase_1, phase_2]
estimated_time: 24 hours (3 days)
risk_level: medium
priority: P1 - Production Reliability
---

## Objective
Implement production-ready webhook retry logic with exponential backoff, proper failure condition handling, and comprehensive monitoring to ensure 99%+ webhook delivery reliability.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase 1 complete (security implementation)
- [ ] Phase 2 complete (webhook management and rate limiting)
- [ ] Understanding of Typeform's retry requirements (2-3 min intervals, 10 hours total)

# Tasks

## 3.1 Webhook Retry Service Implementation
- [ ] 3.1.1 Create webhook retry service
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py` (NEW)
  - Purpose: Production-ready retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] 3.1.2 Implement retry policy configuration
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/config.py`
  - Purpose: Add configurable retry intervals and timeout settings
- [ ] 3.1.3 Add retry queue management
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Queue failed webhooks for retry processing
- [ ] 3.1.4 Implement failure condition detection
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Handle 410/404 responses and 100% failure rate conditions

## 3.2 Enhanced Exception Handling for Retry Logic
- [ ] 3.2.1 Add retry-specific exceptions
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/exceptions.py`
  - Purpose: Create exceptions for retry scenarios (max retries, permanent failures)
- [ ] 3.2.2 Extend WebhookHandler for retry integration
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_handler.py`
  - Purpose: Integrate retry logic into existing webhook processing
- [ ] 3.2.3 Add retry logging and monitoring
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Comprehensive logging of retry attempts and outcomes

## 3.3 Exponential Backoff Implementation
- [ ] 3.3.1 Implement exponential backoff algorithm
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: 2-3 minute initial interval with exponential increase
- [ ] 3.3.2 Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Random jitter to distribute retry attempts
- [ ] 3.3.3 Implement maximum retry duration (10 hours)
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Enforce Typeform's 10-hour total retry window

## 3.4 Failure Condition Handling
- [ ] 3.4.1 Immediate disable for 410/404 responses
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Stop retries immediately for permanent failure responses
- [ ] 3.4.2 100% failure rate detection and disable
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Disable webhook after 24 hours of 100% failure rate
- [ ] 3.4.3 Webhook status management
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_manager.py`
  - Purpose: Update webhook status based on retry outcomes

## 3.5 Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] 3.5.1 Add retry metrics collection
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Collect metrics on retry attempts, success rates, and timing
- [ ] 3.5.2 Implement alerting for retry failures
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Alert on high retry rates or permanent failures
- [ ] 3.5.3 Add retry dashboard support
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
  - Purpose: Expose metrics for operational dashboard monitoring

## 3.6 Integration and Testing
- [ ] 3.6.1 Create retry logic unit tests
  - Files: `tests/contexts/client_onboarding/services/test_webhook_retry.py` (NEW)
  - Purpose: Test retry algorithms, backoff, and failure conditions
- [ ] 3.6.2 Add integration tests for retry scenarios
  - Files: `tests/contexts/client_onboarding/integration/test_webhook_reliability.py` (NEW)
  - Purpose: Test complete retry flow with simulated failures
- [ ] 3.6.3 Create performance tests for retry under load
  - Files: `tests/contexts/client_onboarding/performance/test_retry_performance.py` (NEW)
  - Purpose: Verify retry performance under high volume

## Validation
- [ ] Retry Tests: `poetry run python pytest tests/contexts/client_onboarding/services/test_webhook_retry.py -v`
- [ ] Integration Tests: `poetry run python pytest tests/contexts/client_onboarding/integration/test_webhook_reliability.py -v`
- [ ] Performance Tests: `poetry run python pytest tests/contexts/client_onboarding/performance/test_retry_performance.py -v`
- [ ] Failure Simulation: Test 410/404 immediate disable behavior
- [ ] Load Testing: Verify retry logic under realistic webhook volumes
- [ ] Monitoring Validation: Confirm metrics collection and alerting
- [ ] Lint: `poetry run python ruff check src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`
- [ ] Type: `poetry run python mypy src/contexts/client_onboarding/services/webhook_retry.py`

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Retry logic handles all documented failure scenarios
- [ ] Exponential backoff implemented with proper timing
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting functional
- [ ] Performance acceptable under load
- [ ] 99%+ webhook delivery reliability achieved in testing
