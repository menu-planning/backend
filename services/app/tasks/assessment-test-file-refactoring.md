## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: Multi-file refactoring with clear boundaries, moderate risk of breaking functionality, well-defined structure

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: refactoring
- **Scope**: existing code modification and new file creation
- **Test Coverage**: maintain 100% existing test functionality

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: test case loss during split, import dependency issues
- **Dependencies**: CI/CD pipeline, test runners, existing imports
- **Breaking Potential**: high - could break entire test suite if not done carefully

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: standard
- **Testing Strategy**: validation after each major split
- **Special Considerations**: maintain test execution independence, preserve all functionality

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 3 phases (setup, implementation, validation)
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 needed: no
- **Estimated Complexity**: 4-6 hours
