feature: api-create-recipe-testing
assessed_date: 2024-12-19
complexity: standard

## Feature Overview
**Description**: Create comprehensive test suite for ApiCreateRecipe class to ensure reliable recipe creation via API
**Primary Problem**: ApiCreateRecipe class lacks comprehensive test coverage, creating risk for recipe creation failures
**Business Value**: Ensures API reliability for recipe creation, prevents data corruption, and maintains user trust

## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: Single API component with multiple integration points (domain conversion, validation, error handling), similar to existing ApiUpdateMeal testing patterns

## Scope Definition
**In-Scope**: 
- ApiCreateRecipe class validation and functionality
- to_domain() method conversion logic
- Field validation and error handling
- Integration with CreateRecipe domain command
- Comprehensive test coverage for all fields and scenarios

**Out-of-Scope**: 
- Performance/load testing
- API endpoint testing (focus on schema only)
- Database integration testing
- UI/frontend testing
- Other recipe API classes

**Constraints**: 
- Must follow existing test patterns from ApiUpdateMeal
- Limited to unit and integration testing
- No external service dependencies

## Requirements Profile
**Users**: Backend developers, QA engineers, DevOps teams
**Use Cases**: 
- Recipe creation API validation
- Data integrity verification
- Error handling validation
- Domain object conversion testing

**Success Criteria**: 
- 100% test coverage of ApiCreateRecipe class
- All field validation scenarios covered
- Error handling thoroughly tested
- Domain conversion logic verified

## Technical Considerations
**Integrations**: 
- CreateRecipe domain command
- Pydantic validation system
- Recipe field validation classes
- Domain entity conversion

**Performance**: Standard unit test execution time
**Security**: Input validation and sanitization testing
**Compliance**: Follows existing test patterns and standards
