---
phase: 1
estimated_time: 1 hour
status: COMPLETED ✅
completion_date: 2024-12-27T14:30:00Z

## Objective
Create the shared foundation by extracting common components from the original test file into `conftest.py`. This establishes the base classes and fixtures that all split test files will use.

## Prerequisites
- [x] Backup original `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py`
- [x] Identify current test directory structure

# Tasks

## 1.1 Create Shared Test Base
- [x] 1.1.1 Create `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/conftest.py`
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/conftest.py`
  - Purpose: Extract BaseApiRecipeTest class from original file
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - 464 lines with BaseApiRecipeTest class and 7 fixtures
- [x] 1.1.2 Move all shared imports
  - Include: pytest, factory imports, common utilities
  - Purpose: Centralize import statements
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - 130+ factory functions and utilities imported
- [x] 1.1.3 Extract shared fixtures
  - Move: Common test data fixtures
  - Purpose: Avoid duplication across split files
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - 7 fixtures extracted (simple_recipe, complex_recipe, etc.)

## 1.2 Validate Foundation
- [x] 1.2.1 Test imports work correctly
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/conftest.py`
  - Purpose: Ensure no import errors
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - BaseApiRecipeTest import successful
- [x] 1.2.2 Verify BaseApiRecipeTest functionality
  - Command: `poetry run python -c "from tests.contexts.recipes_catalog.core.adapters.meal.api_schemas.entities.conftest import BaseApiRecipeTest; print('Success')"`
  - Purpose: Confirm base class is properly extracted
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Import and functionality verified

## 1.3 Update Original File
- [x] 1.3.1 Remove extracted components from original
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py`
  - Purpose: Avoid duplication and prepare for split
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - BaseApiRecipeTest class and imports removed from original
- [x] 1.3.2 Update imports in original file
  - Add: `from .conftest import BaseApiRecipeTest`
  - Purpose: Ensure original still works during transition
  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Updated to use shared components via relative imports

## Validation
- [x] Tests: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py::TestApiRecipeBasics::test_from_domain_basic_conversion -v`
- [x] Lint: `poetry run python -m ruff check tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/conftest.py`
- [x] Import verification: No circular imports or missing dependencies
