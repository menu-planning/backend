# Phase 3: Cleanup & Validation

---
phase: 3
estimated_time: 1 hour
---

## Objective
Complete the refactoring by removing the original file, updating references, and performing comprehensive validation to ensure the split worked correctly.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase 2 completed (all 6 new test files created and passing)
- [ ] All new test files inherit from BaseApiRecipeTest in conftest.py

# Tasks

## 3.1 Final Validation
- [ ] 3.1.1 Run all new test files together
  - Command: `pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_*.py -v`
  - Purpose: Ensure all split files work together without conflicts
- [ ] 3.1.2 Compare test counts
  - Command: `pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py --collect-only | grep -c "test_"`
  - Command: `pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_core.py tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_validation.py tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_performance.py tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_serialization.py tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_edge_cases.py tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_coverage.py --collect-only | grep -c "test_"`
  - Purpose: Verify same number of tests in split files as original
- [ ] 3.1.3 Run coverage comparison
  - Command: `pytest --cov=src.contexts.recipes_catalog.core.adapters.meal.api_schemas.entities.api_recipe tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py --cov-report=term-missing > coverage_before.txt`
  - Command: `pytest --cov=src.contexts.recipes_catalog.core.adapters.meal.api_schemas.entities.api_recipe tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_*.py --cov-report=term-missing > coverage_after.txt`
  - Purpose: Ensure coverage is maintained

## 3.2 Remove Original File
- [ ] 3.2.1 Final backup of original file
  - Command: `cp tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py.backup`
  - Purpose: Create final backup before removal
- [ ] 3.2.2 Remove original test file
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py`
  - Purpose: Complete the refactoring by removing original file

## 3.3 Update References
- [ ] 3.3.1 Search for references to original file
  - Command: `grep -r "test_api_recipe_comprehensive" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=__pycache__`
  - Purpose: Find any remaining references to original file
- [ ] 3.3.2 Update CI/CD configuration
  - Files: Any configuration files that specifically reference the original test file
  - Purpose: Ensure CI/CD can find and run the new test files
- [ ] 3.3.3 Update documentation
  - Files: Any documentation that references the original test file
  - Purpose: Keep documentation current

## 3.4 Performance Validation
- [ ] 3.4.1 Test parallel execution
  - Command: `pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_*.py -n auto`
  - Purpose: Verify that split files can run in parallel (requires pytest-xdist)
- [ ] 3.4.2 Time comparison
  - Command: `time pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_*.py`
  - Purpose: Compare execution time with original file
- [ ] 3.4.3 Memory usage check
  - Command: `pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_*.py --memory-profiler`
  - Purpose: Verify memory usage is reasonable (requires pytest-memory-profiler)

## Validation
- [ ] All split tests pass: `pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_*.py -v`
- [ ] Coverage maintained: Compare coverage_before.txt and coverage_after.txt
- [ ] No references to original file remain
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- [ ] Test execution time is equal or better than original
- [ ] All 7 success criteria from guide.md are met

## Success Criteria Check
- [ ] All 6 new test files created with correct line counts
- [ ] Original test file removed without breaking functionality
- [ ] All tests pass with identical coverage metrics
- [ ] No import or dependency errors
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs successfully with new structure
- [ ] Parallel execution works correctly
- [ ] Total execution time is equal or better than original
