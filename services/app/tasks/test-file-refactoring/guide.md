# Implementation Guide: Test File Refactoring

feature: test-file-refactoring
complexity: standard
risk_level: medium
estimated_time: 4-6 hours
phases: 3

## Overview
Split the 3569-line `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py` file into 7 focused test files for better maintainability and parallel execution. This refactoring will improve test organization, reduce CI/CD runtime, and enhance developer productivity.

## Architecture
```

└── test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py     # REMOVE after split

## Files to Modify/Create

### Core Files
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/conftest.py` - Shared BaseApiRecipeTest class and fixtures (NEW)
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_core.py` - Core conversion functionality (NEW)
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_validation.py` - Validation and error handling (NEW)
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_performance.py` - Performance benchmarks (NEW)
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_serialization.py` - JSON serialization tests (NEW)
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_edge_cases.py` - Edge cases and boundary conditions (NEW)
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_coverage.py` - Coverage validation (NEW)
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py` - Original file (REMOVE)

### Supporting Files
- Any CI/CD configuration files that reference the original test file (MODIFIED)
- Test runner configurations (MODIFIED)

## Testing Strategy
- **Validation Command**: `pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_*.py -v`
- **Coverage Target**: Maintain 100% of existing coverage
- **Parallel Execution**: Files should run independently
- **Performance**: Total execution time should be equal or better

## Phase Dependencies
```
Phase 1: Setup Foundation
  ↓
Phase 2: Split Implementation  
  ↓
Phase 3: Cleanup & Validation
```

## Risk Mitigation
- **Test Case Loss**: Verify line counts and test method counts before/after
- **Import Dependencies**: Update all import statements systematically
- **CI/CD Breaking**: Test locally before committing changes
- **Coverage Gaps**: Run coverage reports to ensure no functionality lost

## Success Criteria
1. All 7 new test files created with correct line counts
2. Original test file removed without breaking functionality
3. All tests pass with identical coverage metrics
4. No import or dependency errors
5. CI/CD pipeline runs successfully with new structure
