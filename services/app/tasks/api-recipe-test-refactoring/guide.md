## Overview
Refactor `test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py` to improve test maintainability, reliability, and developer productivity by replacing factory methods with explicit test data, breaking down complex tests, and implementing environment-agnostic performance assertions.

## Architecture

### Current Structure
- Complex factory-heavy test suite with 2000+ lines
- Multiple test classes: `BaseApiRecipeTest`, `TestApiRecipeBasics`, `TestApiRecipeRoundTrip`, etc.
- External dependencies on factory methods from data_factories
- Performance tests with fixed time limits

### Target Structure
- Explicit test data defined within test methods
- Focused single-purpose test methods
- Environment-agnostic performance assertions
- Reduced coupling to external factory methods

## Files to Modify/Create

### Core Files
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py` - Main refactoring target (MODIFIED)

### Reference Files (Read-Only)
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/data_factories/api_recipe_data_factories.py` - Factory reference
- `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/data_factories/recipe/recipe_domain_factories.py` - Domain factory reference

## Testing Strategy

### Commands
- Run tests: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py -v`
- Run with coverage: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py --cov=src --cov-report=html`
- Performance tests: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py -k performance -v`

### Coverage Target
- Maintain existing test coverage (>95% as specified in test)
- Improve test readability and maintainability
- Ensure performance test reliability

## Risk Mitigation
- **Test Functionality Loss**: Run comprehensive before/after validation
- **Performance Test Instability**: Implement environment-agnostic approaches
- **Over-refactoring**: Focus on problematic areas first
- **Time Investment**: Phase-by-phase validation with rollback capability

## Success Criteria
1. All existing tests pass after refactoring
2. Test coverage maintained at current levels
3. Performance tests work consistently across environments
4. Developers can understand test scenarios 50% faster
5. Reduced coupling to external factory methods

## Constraints
- **No Production Changes**: Strict constraint against modifying production codebase
- **Single File Focus**: Refactoring limited to test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py only
- **Coverage Preservation**: Must maintain existing test coverage levels
