# Phase 4: Performance Test Enhancement

---
phase: 4
depends_on: [3]
estimated_time: 2 days
risk_level: medium
---

## Objective
Analyze current performance test limitations, implement environment-agnostic performance assertions, remove fixed time limits, and validate performance tests across environments.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase 3 test decomposition complete
- [ ] Test methods focused and isolated
- [ ] All functionality tests passing

# Tasks

## 4.1 Performance Test Analysis
- [ ] 4.1.1 Identify current performance tests
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py`
  - Purpose: Find tests with timing assertions and fixed time limits
- [ ] 4.1.2 Document performance test failures
  - Purpose: Understand why tests fail across environments
- [ ] 4.1.3 Analyze performance test patterns
  - Purpose: Identify common timing-based assertions

## 4.2 Environment-Agnostic Implementation
- [ ] 4.2.1 Replace fixed time limits with relative measures
  - Purpose: Remove machine-speed dependencies
- [ ] 4.2.2 Implement performance comparison tests
  - Purpose: Compare operation speeds relatively (e.g., bulk vs individual)
- [ ] 4.2.3 Create scalability-based assertions
  - Purpose: Test that operations scale reasonably with data size

## 4.3 Performance Test Restructuring
- [ ] 4.3.1 Focus on operation efficiency
  - Purpose: Test algorithmic efficiency rather than absolute timing
- [ ] 4.3.2 Implement throughput-based tests
  - Purpose: Test operations per unit of input rather than absolute time
- [ ] 4.3.3 Add memory usage considerations
  - Purpose: Ensure performance improvements don't increase memory usage

## 4.4 Cross-Environment Validation
- [ ] 4.4.1 Test performance assertions locally
  - Purpose: Validate new performance tests work consistently
- [ ] 4.4.2 Document performance expectations
  - Purpose: Clearly state what performance tests validate
- [ ] 4.4.3 Remove problematic timing assertions
  - Purpose: Eliminate tests that depend on machine specifications

## Validation
- [ ] Performance tests: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py -k performance -v`
- [ ] All performance tests pass consistently
- [ ] No fixed time limits remain
- [ ] Performance tests focus on relative efficiency
- [ ] Tests work across different environments
