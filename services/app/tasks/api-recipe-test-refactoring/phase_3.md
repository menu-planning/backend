## Objective
Break down complex multi-assertion tests into focused single-purpose test methods with clear, descriptive names and ensure individual test isolation.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase 2 factory replacement complete
- [ ] Explicit test data in place
- [ ] Test functionality validated

# Tasks

## 3.1 Complex Test Identification
- [ ] 3.1.1 Identify multi-assertion test methods
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py`
  - Purpose: Find tests that validate multiple concerns
- [ ] 3.1.2 Map test responsibilities
  - Purpose: Understand what each complex test validates
- [ ] 3.1.3 Plan decomposition strategy
  - Purpose: Design how to split tests while maintaining coverage

## 3.2 Test Method Decomposition
- [ ] 3.2.1 Split conversion method tests
  - Purpose: Separate from_domain, to_domain, from_orm_model tests
- [ ] 3.2.2 Decompose validation tests
  - Purpose: Create focused field validation tests
- [ ] 3.2.3 Break down round-trip tests
  - Purpose: Separate API→domain→API and domain→API→domain tests

## 3.3 Descriptive Test Naming
- [ ] 3.3.1 Create clear test method names
  - Purpose: Make test failures point to specific functionality
- [ ] 3.3.2 Add descriptive docstrings
  - Purpose: Document test scenarios and expected behavior
- [ ] 3.3.3 Group related tests logically
  - Purpose: Organize tests within classes for better maintainability

## 3.4 Test Isolation Validation
- [ ] 3.4.1 Ensure independent test data
  - Purpose: Verify tests don't depend on each other
- [ ] 3.4.2 Validate test method isolation
  - Purpose: Each test should pass independently
- [ ] 3.4.3 Check fixture usage
  - Purpose: Ensure fixtures provide isolated data

## Validation
- [ ] Tests: `poetry run python -m pytest tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py -v`
- [ ] Individual test isolation verified
- [ ] All decomposed tests pass
- [ ] Coverage maintained
- [ ] Test names clearly describe purpose
