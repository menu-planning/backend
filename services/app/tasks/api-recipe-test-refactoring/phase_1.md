## Objective
Analyze current test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py structure, identify factory method usage patterns, document existing test coverage, and plan test decomposition strategy.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Access to test file and related factory methods
- [ ] Understanding of existing test structure

# Tasks

## 1.1 Current Test Structure Analysis
- [ ] 1.1.1 Analyze test file structure and organization
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/test_api_recipe_comprehensive.py`
  - Purpose: Document current test classes and their responsibilities
- [ ] 1.1.2 Identify all test classes and their purposes
  - Purpose: Map test organization (BaseApiRecipeTest, TestApiRecipeBasics, etc.)
- [ ] 1.1.3 Count total lines and test methods
  - Purpose: Establish baseline metrics for refactoring progress

## 1.2 Factory Method Usage Analysis
- [ ] 1.2.1 Document factory method dependencies
  - Files: `tests/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/adapters/meal/api_schemas/entities/data_factories/api_recipe_data_factories.py`
  - Purpose: Map which factory methods are used and how frequently
- [ ] 1.2.2 Identify complex factory usage patterns
  - Purpose: Determine which factory calls need explicit data replacement
- [ ] 1.2.3 Analyze factory method coupling
  - Purpose: Understand dependencies between factory methods

## 1.3 Test Coverage Documentation
- [ ] 1.3.1 Run coverage analysis on current tests
  - Purpose: Establish baseline coverage metrics
- [ ] 1.3.2 Document test scenarios covered
  - Purpose: Ensure no scenarios are lost during refactoring
- [ ] 1.3.3 Identify critical test paths
  - Purpose: Prioritize which tests need careful handling

## 1.4 Test Decomposition Strategy
- [ ] 1.4.1 Identify complex multi-assertion tests
  - Purpose: Plan how to break down complex tests
- [ ] 1.4.2 Map test dependencies and order
  - Purpose: Understand test execution flow
- [ ] 1.4.3 Plan performance test improvements
  - Purpose: Design environment-agnostic performance assertions

## Validation
- [ ] Analysis documentation complete
- [ ] Factory usage patterns documented
- [ ] Coverage baseline established
- [ ] Decomposition strategy defined
- [ ] Ready for Phase 2 implementation
