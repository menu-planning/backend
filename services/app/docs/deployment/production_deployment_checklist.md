# Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment

### Code Preparation
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Security scan completed with no critical issues
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validated
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Environment Preparation
- [ ] Production environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migration scripts reviewed
- [ ] Backup of current production state completed
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and reviewed

### Security Validation
- [ ] Webhook secrets configured (minimum 20 characters)
- [ ] TypeForm API keys validated
- [ ] SSL certificates valid and up to date
- [ ] Security compliance documented

## Deployment Process

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled and communicated
- [ ] Load balancer configured for gradual rollout
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Emergency contacts notified

### Phase 2: Database Updates
```bash
# Database migration
- [ ] Backup current database: `pg_dump production > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql`
- [ ] Run migrations: `poetry run alembic upgrade head`
- [ ] Verify migration success: `poetry run alembic current`
```

### Phase 3: Application Deployment
```bash
# Application update
- [ ] Stop current services: `systemctl stop webhook-service`
- [ ] Deploy new code: `git checkout production-release-tag`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `poetry install --only=main`
- [ ] Update configuration files
- [ ] Start services: `systemctl start webhook-service`
```

### Phase 4: Configuration Validation
```bash
# Validate configuration
- [ ] Check config health: `poetry run python -c "from src.contexts.client_onboarding.config import config; print(config.health_check())"`
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Test database connectivity
- [ ] Validate TypeForm API connectivity
```

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Immediate Checks (0-15 minutes)
- [ ] Services started successfully
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] Basic health check endpoint responding
- [ ] Database connectivity confirmed

### Functional Testing (15-30 minutes)
```bash
# Test webhook processing
- [ ] Send test webhook: `curl -X POST $WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT -H "Typeform-Signature: ..." -d '{...}'`
- [ ] Verify signature validation working
- [ ] Check database record creation
- [ ] Validate rate limiting enforcement
```

### Performance Validation (30-60 minutes)
- [ ] Monitor webhook processing latency (<50ms target)
- [ ] Check concurrent processing capability
- [ ] Verify memory usage stable
- [ ] Monitor rate limiting compliance (2 req/sec)

### Security Validation (Throughout deployment)
- [ ] Signature verification working correctly
- [ ] No security alerts triggered
- [ ] Replay attack protection active
- [ ] Audit logging functional

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Critical Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] Webhook success rate (>99% target)
- [ ] Processing latency (<50ms average)
- [ ] Memory usage (<200MB growth)
- [ ] Rate limiting compliance
- [ ] Retry queue depth

### Alert Configuration
- [ ] Critical alerts configured (success rate <95%)
- [ ] Warning alerts configured (latency >100ms)
- [ ] Security alerts active (signature failures)
- [ ] Performance alerts enabled

## Quality Gates

### Security Gates
- [ ] All security tests passing (43 tests)
- [ ] Zero critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] OWASP compliance validated
- [ ] Penetration testing completed

### Performance Gates
- [ ] Webhook latency <50ms
- [ ] Concurrent processing >100/s
- [ ] Memory growth <200MB under load
- [ ] Rate limiting compliance 95%+

### Functional Gates
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] E2E tests with real TypeForm API passing
- [ ] Retry logic validated
- [ ] Webhook management functional

## Rollback Criteria

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- [ ] Webhook success rate drops below 90%
- [ ] Critical security alerts
- [ ] Service unable to start
- [ ] Database connectivity issues

### Manual Rollback Decision Points
- [ ] Performance degradation >20%
- [ ] Unexpected errors in logs
- [ ] TypeForm API integration issues
- [ ] Customer-reported issues

## Communication

### Internal Communication
- [ ] Engineering team notified of deployment start
- [ ] Status updates every 30 minutes during deployment
- [ ] Success/failure notification sent
- [ ] Post-deployment summary documented

### External Communication (if needed)
- [ ] Customer support team informed
- [ ] Status page updated if maintenance required
- [ ] User notifications if service interruption expected

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (First 2 hours)
- [ ] Monitor all metrics closely
- [ ] Review error logs for any issues
- [ ] Validate customer-facing functionality
- [ ] Document any unexpected issues

### Short-term (First 24 hours)
- [ ] Performance trend analysis
- [ ] Security event review
- [ ] Customer feedback monitoring
- [ ] System stability validation

### Long-term (First week)
- [ ] Weekly performance review
- [ ] Security audit validation
- [ ] Customer satisfaction metrics
- [ ] Lessons learned documentation
