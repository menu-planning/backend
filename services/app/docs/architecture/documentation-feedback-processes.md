      - name: Add labels based on content
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            const title = context.payload.issue.title.toLowerCase();
            const body = context.payload.issue.body.toLowerCase();
            
            // Auto-label based on keywords
            const labels = [];
            if (body.includes('quick start')) labels.push('quick-start');
            if (body.includes('error') || body.includes('bug')) labels.push('bug');
            if (body.includes('improvement')) labels.push('enhancement');
            if (body.includes('critical')) labels.push('priority-high');
            
            // Set priority based on user indicators
            if (body.includes('blocks essential') || body.includes('critical')) {
              labels.push('priority-critical');
            }
            
            github.rest.issues.addLabels({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: context.payload.issue.number,
              labels: labels
            });
      
      - name: Auto-assign to documentation team
        run: |
          # Assign based on section affected
          echo "Auto-assigning based on documentation section"
      
      - name: Create tracking entry
        run: |
          # Add to feedback tracking spreadsheet/database
