# Documentation Versioning Strategy

## üéØ Purpose
This strategy ensures consistent, trackable versioning of AI agent onboarding documentation that aligns with code releases and maintains backward compatibility when needed.

## üìã Versioning Principles

### 1. Documentation Follows Code
- Documentation versions align with application releases
- Major documentation changes accompany major code releases
- Documentation patches can be released independently for urgent fixes

### 2. Semantic Versioning for Documentation
We use a modified semantic versioning approach:
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., `v2.1.3`)
- **MAJOR**: Significant architectural changes, new workflows, breaking changes in documented patterns
- **MINOR**: New sections, enhanced examples, additional workflows, new patterns
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, typo corrections, link updates, example fixes

### 3. Release Alignment Strategy
- **Code Release**: Documentation MAJOR/MINOR version
- **Documentation Enhancement**: Documentation MINOR version
- **Bug Fixes/Updates**: Documentation PATCH version
- **Emergency Fixes**: Documentation PATCH with hotfix suffix

## üìä Version Numbering System

### Version Format: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-SUFFIX]`

#### MAJOR Version (X.0.0)
Increment when:
- [ ] New domain aggregates require significant workflow changes
- [ ] Architecture patterns fundamentally change
- [ ] Development workflow significantly changes
- [ ] Multiple documentation files require major restructuring
- [ ] Breaking changes in documented APIs/patterns

**Examples:**
- `v1.0.0` ‚Üí `v2.0.0`: Migration from DDD to event sourcing architecture
- `v2.0.0` ‚Üí `v3.0.0`: New microservices architecture with different onboarding workflow

#### MINOR Version (X.Y.0) 
Increment when:
- [ ] New workflow sections added to existing files
- [ ] Additional decision trees or pattern examples
- [ ] New troubleshooting scenarios
- [ ] Enhanced performance optimization guides
- [ ] New Lambda deployment patterns
- [ ] Additional testing strategies

**Examples:**
- `v1.1.0`: Added "GraphQL API" workflow to ai-agent-workflows.md
- `v1.2.0`: New "Microservices Communication" patterns in pattern-library.md
- `v1.3.0`: Enhanced troubleshooting guide with Kubernetes deployment issues

#### PATCH Version (X.Y.Z)
Increment when:
- [ ] Fix broken code examples
- [ ] Update file paths or imports
- [ ] Correct typos or formatting issues
- [ ] Update performance metrics/benchmarks
- [ ] Fix broken internal/external links
- [ ] Update command examples for new tool versions

**Examples:**
- `v1.1.1`: Fixed import paths in quick-start-guide.md
- `v1.1.2`: Updated pytest command examples
- `v1.1.3`: Corrected performance benchmarks in technical-specifications.md

#### Suffixes
- **-alpha**: Pre-release version for testing
- **-beta**: Release candidate for team review
- **-hotfix**: Emergency patch for critical issues
- **-rc**: Release candidate

**Examples:**
- `v1.2.0-alpha`: New patterns being tested
- `v1.1.4-hotfix`: Critical security update in Lambda examples

## üè∑Ô∏è Tagging Strategy

### Git Tag Format
```bash
# Standard release
git tag -a "docs-v1.2.0" -m "Enhanced AI workflows with GraphQL patterns"

# Pre-release
git tag -a "docs-v1.2.0-alpha" -m "Alpha version with new GraphQL workflows"

# Hotfix
git tag -a "docs-v1.1.4-hotfix" -m "Critical fix for security vulnerability in Lambda examples"
```

### Tag Naming Convention
- **Prefix**: `docs-` to distinguish from code releases
- **Version**: Standard semantic version
- **Message**: Brief description of main changes

### Tagging Commands
```bash
# List all documentation tags
git tag -l "docs-*"

# Show specific tag details
git show docs-v1.2.0

# Create and push tag
git tag -a "docs-v1.2.0" -m "Documentation release notes"
git push origin docs-v1.2.0

# Delete tag (if needed)
git tag -d docs-v1.2.0
git push origin --delete docs-v1.2.0
```

## üìÖ Release Schedule

### Regular Release Cycle
- **Monthly**: Patch releases for accumulated fixes
- **Quarterly**: Minor releases for new content/enhancements  
- **Annually**: Major version consideration (typically aligns with major code architecture changes)
- **As-needed**: Hotfix releases for critical issues

### Release Triggers

#### Automatic Minor Release Triggers
- [ ] New aggregates added to domain model
- [ ] New API endpoints require documentation
- [ ] New deployment/infrastructure patterns introduced
- [ ] New testing frameworks or patterns adopted
- [ ] Performance optimization strategies discovered

#### Automatic Patch Release Triggers
- [ ] Code examples break due to dependency updates
- [ ] File paths change due to restructuring
- [ ] Tool command syntax changes (pytest, mypy, etc.)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks become outdated
- [ ] New troubleshooting scenarios discovered

#### Manual Major Release Consideration
- [ ] Architecture paradigm changes (DDD ‚Üí Event Sourcing ‚Üí CQRS)
- [ ] Platform changes (Lambda ‚Üí Kubernetes ‚Üí Serverless)
- [ ] Development methodology changes (TDD ‚Üí BDD ‚Üí DDD)
- [ ] Multiple breaking changes accumulate

```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b docs/feature/new-patterns

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add docs/architecture/
git commit -m "feat: add new async patterns to workflows guide"

# 3. Create PR with version impact in description
# PR Title: "[MINOR] Add async patterns to workflow guide"

# 4. After review and merge, tag release
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a "docs-v1.2.0" -m "Add async patterns and enhanced examples"
git push origin docs-v1.2.0
```

## üìä Version Tracking

### Metadata in Documentation Files
Each major documentation file should include version metadata:

```markdown
---
version: "1.2.0"
last_updated: "2024-01-15"
next_review: "2024-04-15"
maintainer: "team@example.com"
---
```

### Version Compatibility Matrix
Track compatibility between documentation and code versions:

| Documentation Version | Compatible Code Versions | Notes |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| docs-v1.0.0         | app-v1.0.0 - app-v1.2.x | Initial release |
| docs-v1.1.0         | app-v1.1.0 - app-v1.3.x | Added GraphQL workflows |
| docs-v1.2.0         | app-v1.2.0 - app-v1.4.x | Enhanced async patterns |

### Deprecation Policy
- **Notice Period**: 2 minor versions before removal
- **Support Period**: Continue supporting previous major version for 6 months
- **Migration Guide**: Always provide upgrade path for breaking changes

Example:
```markdown
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPRECATED**: The workflow described in section X.Y is deprecated as of docs-v1.2.0 
> and will be removed in docs-v2.0.0. Use the new workflow in section Z.A instead.
> See [Migration Guide](../migrations/v1-to-v2.md) for details.
```

## üîç Version Validation

### Pre-Release Checklist
Before tagging any version:

- [ ] Run all validation commands from maintenance checklist
- [ ] Test examples in clean environment
- [ ] Verify all internal links work
- [ ] Check external references are current
- [ ] Validate version number follows semantic versioning rules
- [ ] Confirm release notes are complete and accurate
- [ ] Verify compatibility matrix is updated

### Automated Validation
```bash
# Script: scripts/validate-docs-version.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "üîç Validating documentation for release..."

# Check version consistency across files
echo "Checking version metadata..."
grep -r "version:" docs/architecture/ | grep -v ".git"

# Validate all links
echo "Validating internal links..."
find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "\[.*\](.*\.md)" {} \; | xargs -I {} bash -c 'echo "Checking: {}"; markdown-link-check {}'

# Test code examples  
echo "Testing code examples..."
poetry run python scripts/test-doc-examples.py

# Check for TODO/FIXME markers
echo "Checking for incomplete sections..."
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" docs/architecture/ || echo "‚úÖ No incomplete markers found"

echo "‚úÖ Documentation validation complete"
```

## üìà Metrics and Analytics

### Version Metrics to Track
- [ ] Release frequency (monthly/quarterly averages)
- [ ] Time between code release and documentation update
- [ ] Number of hotfixes per quarter (target: <2)
- [ ] Documentation coverage of new features (target: 100%)
- [ ] User feedback correlation with version quality

### Success Metrics
- **Currency**: Documentation never more than 1 release cycle behind code
- **Stability**: <1 hotfix per quarter on average
- **Completeness**: All new features documented within 1 week of code release
- **Quality**: >95% of examples work without modification
- **Usability**: User feedback score >4.5/5 for documentation quality

## üöÄ Release Automation

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs-release.yml
