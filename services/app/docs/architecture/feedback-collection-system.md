## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

### For AI Agents Using Documentation

1. **Start Each Session**: Note start time and task objective
2. **Log Issues Immediately**: Don't wait until end of session
3. **Rate Effectiveness**: Use 1-5 scale consistently
4. **Be Specific**: Provide actionable feedback, not just "this is confusing"
5. **Complete Session Feedback**: Fill out template after significant tasks

### For Documentation Maintainers

1. **Review Weekly**: Analyze all feedback collected during the week
2. **Prioritize by Impact**: Focus on issues affecting multiple users
3. **Quick Wins First**: Address simple fixes to build momentum
4. **Validate Changes**: Test improvements with affected scenarios
5. **Close the Loop**: Follow up on major issues to confirm resolution

### Quality Assurance Checks

Before implementing feedback-based changes:
- [ ] Verify the issue is reproducible
- [ ] Confirm the suggested fix addresses the root cause
- [ ] Test the change doesn't break other scenarios
- [ ] Update related documentation sections consistently
- [ ] Add the fix to regression testing if applicable
