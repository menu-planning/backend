## üéØ Success Metrics

The documentation maintenance is successful when:

1. **Accuracy**: >95% of code examples work without modification
2. **Currency**: No documentation is more than 1 release cycle out of date
3. **Completeness**: New patterns/issues are documented within defined SLAs
4. **Efficiency**: Maintenance process takes <4 hours per month baseline
5. **Quality**: User feedback indicates documentation is helpful and current

This checklist ensures our comprehensive AI agent onboarding documentation remains a valuable, current resource that continues to enable rapid onboarding and effective development work.
