# Task Quality Report: FastAPI Support

## Overall Score: 9/10

### Structure Quality: 3/3
- Folder organization: ✓ (5 phases with clear dependencies)
- File naming: ✓ (consistent phase_N.md format)
- Token limits: ✓ (all files under limits: guide.md 77 lines, phases 57-96 lines each)

### Content Quality: 4/4
- Task clarity: 2/2 (specific, actionable tasks with clear purposes)
- Technical accuracy: 2/2 (correct file paths, commands, dependencies)

### Completeness: 2/3
- Testing strategy: ✓ (comprehensive testing across all phases)
- Risk mitigation: ✓ (thread safety, async compatibility, performance)
- Success criteria: ✓ (measurable outcomes defined)
- **Missing**: User-specific lifespan and DI patterns integration

## Issues Found
1. **Missing User Requirements**: The specific lifespan management pattern and DI logic provided by user not fully integrated into task structure
2. **Minor**: Some validation commands could be more specific to user's `uv run python` preference

## Recommendations
1. **Integrate User Patterns**: Add specific tasks for implementing the provided lifespan, main.py, and deps.py patterns
2. **Enhance DI Tasks**: Include specific tasks for the MessageBus spawn_fn and limiter integration
3. **Add Pattern Validation**: Include validation steps for the specific architectural patterns

## Status
- Ready for execution: Yes (with refinements)
- Requires refinement: Yes (to integrate user-specific patterns)

## Next Steps
Apply refinements to integrate user-specific lifespan and DI patterns into the task structure.
