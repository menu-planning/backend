# Refinements Applied to FastAPI Support Tasks

## Changes Made
- **Added User-Specific Pattern Implementation**: New section 1.4 in Phase 1 with specific tasks for implementing the provided lifespan, main.py, and deps.py patterns
- **Enhanced DI Integration**: Updated dependency injection tasks to include specific MessageBus spawn_fn and bg_limiter binding
- **Added Pattern Validation**: Included validation steps for the specific architectural patterns
- **Updated File Descriptions**: Enhanced file descriptions to reflect the specific patterns and requirements

## Token Impact
- guide.md: 77 lines (unchanged)
- phase_1.md: 75 lines (increased from 69 lines)
- Other phases: unchanged

## Quality Maintained
- All files under limits: ✓
- Dependencies updated: ✓
- Validation preserved: ✓
- User requirements integrated: ✓

## Key Integrations
1. **Lifespan Pattern**: anyio-based lifespan with CapacityLimiter(64) and supervised background tasks
2. **Main Pattern**: FastAPI app with lifespan, startup/shutdown events, and container state management
3. **DI Pattern**: Request-scoped MessageBus with spawn_fn and bg_limiter binding
4. **Validation**: Specific validation commands for each pattern

Ready for execution with user-specific patterns fully integrated.
