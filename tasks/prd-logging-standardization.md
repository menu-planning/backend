## Overview
**Problem**: The application currently uses a mix of standard logging and structured logging (structlog), leading to inconsistent log formats, suboptimal log placement, and unclear log messages that hinder debugging and monitoring.

**Solution**: Migrate all logging to structured logging, audit and optimize log placement across all modules, and standardize log message formats for better observability.

**Value**: Improved debugging efficiency, better production monitoring, enhanced developer experience, and consistent observability across the entire application.

## Goals & Scope
### Goals
1. Migrate all standard logger usage to structured logger (structlog) across src/ directory
2. Audit and optimize log placement to ensure appropriate logging coverage
3. Standardize log message formats for consistency and clarity
4. Maintain existing correlation ID functionality and ELK/CloudWatch compatibility
5. Improve overall application observability without performance degradation

### Out of Scope
1. Changes to the logging infrastructure (logger.py)
2. Test files logging patterns
3. External service logging configurations
4. Log aggregation or monitoring tools setup
5. Logging in directories outside of src/

## User Stories
### Story 1: Developer Debugging
**As a** developer **I want** consistent structured logs across all modules **So that** I can efficiently debug issues using standardized log formats and correlation IDs.
- [ ] All modules use structlog with consistent format
- [ ] Correlation IDs are present in all relevant log entries
- [ ] Log messages provide clear context and actionable information

### Story 2: Production Monitoring
**As a** DevOps engineer **I want** optimal log placement and clear messages **So that** I can quickly identify and resolve production issues.
- [ ] Critical operations are logged with appropriate detail
- [ ] Performance-sensitive paths have minimal logging overhead
- [ ] Error conditions include sufficient context for resolution

### Story 3: System Observability
**As a** system administrator **I want** structured logs compatible with ELK/CloudWatch **So that** I can create effective dashboards and alerts.
- [ ] All logs maintain JSON structure for parsing
- [ ] Log levels are consistently applied across modules
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly excluded from logs

## Technical Requirements
### Architecture
- Utilize existing StructlogFactory from src/logging/logger.py
- Maintain correlation ID context using existing correlation_id_ctx
- Preserve ELK/CloudWatch JSON formatting
- Use structured logging patterns established in middleware

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Audit current logging usage across 51 files with 440+ logger calls
2. **Phase 2**: Replace standard logger imports with structured logger
3. **Phase 3**: Optimize log placement and improve message quality
4. **Phase 4**: Validate correlation ID functionality and performance

### Integration Points
- Existing logging infrastructure (logger.py)
- ELK/CloudWatch log aggregation systems
- Correlation ID context management
- Middleware logging strategies

## Functional Requirements
1. **Logger Migration**: Replace all instances of standard logging with structlog
   - Import StructlogFactory instead of LoggerFactory
   - Use structlog.get_logger() instead of logging.getLogger()
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition

2. **Log Placement Optimization**: Ensure appropriate logging coverage
   - Log entry/exit points for critical business operations
   - Log error conditions with sufficient context
   - Remove redundant or overly verbose logging
   - Add missing logs for important state changes

3. **Message Standardization**: Implement consistent log message formats
   - Use structured data instead of string interpolation
   - Include relevant context (IDs, parameters, state)
   - Standardize log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
   - Exclude sensitive data (PII, secrets, tokens)

4. **Correlation ID Preservation**: Maintain existing correlation tracking
   - Ensure correlation IDs propagate through all log messages
   - Preserve context across async operations
   - Maintain compatibility with existing middleware

## Quality Requirements
- **Performance**: No measurable performance degradation from logging changes
- **Security**: No sensitive data exposed in log messages
- **Compatibility**: Maintain ELK/CloudWatch JSON format compatibility
- **Consistency**: Uniform logging patterns across all modules

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for logging behavior in critical components
- Integration tests to verify correlation ID propagation
- Performance tests to ensure no degradation
- Manual testing of log output format and content
- Validation of ELK/CloudWatch compatibility

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Audit and Planning (2 days)
- [ ] Analyze current logging patterns across all 51 files
- [ ] Identify standard logger usage requiring migration
- [ ] Document current log placement and identify gaps/redundancies
- [ ] Create migration checklist and validation criteria

### Phase 2: Core Migration (5 days)
- [ ] Replace standard logger imports with structured logger
- [ ] Update logger instantiation patterns
- [ ] Migrate log calls to structured format
- [ ] Ensure correlation ID functionality is preserved

### Phase 3: Optimization and Standardization (3 days)
- [ ] Optimize log placement based on audit findings
- [ ] Standardize log message formats and levels
- [ ] Remove redundant logging and add missing logs
- [ ] Implement consistent structured data patterns

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing (2 days)
- [ ] Validate correlation ID propagation
- [ ] Test ELK/CloudWatch compatibility
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Documentation and team review

## Success Metrics
- 100% migration from standard to structured logging (0 remaining logger. calls)
- Consistent log message format across all modules
- Maintained correlation ID functionality in all log entries
- No performance degradation (< 5% impact on response times)
- Successful ELK/CloudWatch log parsing and indexing

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Performance Impact**: Structured logging overhead - *Mitigation: Performance testing and optimization*
- **Correlation ID Loss**: Context loss during migration - *Mitigation: Thorough testing of context propagation*
- **Breaking Changes**: Incompatible log format changes - *Mitigation: Gradual migration with validation*
- **Missing Logs**: Important events not logged - *Mitigation: Comprehensive audit and review process*

## Dependencies
- Existing logging infrastructure (logger.py, StructlogFactory)
- ELK/CloudWatch log aggregation systems
- Correlation ID context management system
- Development team availability for testing and validation
