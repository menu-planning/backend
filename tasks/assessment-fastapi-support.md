## Complexity Determination
**Level**: detailed
**Reasoning**: System-wide changes affecting all 4 business contexts, complex middleware adaptation, thread safety requirements, async compatibility needs, and integration with multiple external services (Cognito, PostgreSQL, Railway)

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: new feature
- **Scope**: new FastAPI components + adapting existing middleware system
- **Test Coverage**: existing Lambda tests can be adapted for FastAPI

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Thread safety in multithreaded FastAPI environment, async compatibility, middleware adaptation complexity, Cognito JWT handling
- **Dependencies**: FastAPI framework, Cognito JWT validation, PostgreSQL async drivers, Railway deployment
- **Breaking Potential**: Low (Lambda code remains unchanged, FastAPI runs alongside)

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: detailed
- **Testing Strategy**: comprehensive testing with unit, integration, e2e, performance, thread safety, and async tests
- **Special Considerations**: Specific lifespan management, dependency injection patterns, and background task supervision

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 5 phases (Phase 0: Prerequisites, Phase 1: Core Infrastructure, Phase 2: Authentication, Phase 3: Context Endpoints, Phase 4: Railway Deployment)
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 needed: yes (thread safety analysis, async compatibility setup)
- **Estimated Complexity**: 4-5 weeks (detailed implementation)

## Next Step
Ready for task structure generation with generate-task-structure.mdc
