# PRD Quality Report: Logging Standardization

## Overall Score: 9/10

### Structure Quality: 3/3
- Format & metadata: ✓
- Section completeness: ✓
- Token compliance: ✓

### Content Quality: 4/4
- Problem/solution clarity: 2/2
- Requirements quality: 2/2

### Technical Quality: 2/3
- Scope definition: ✓
- Risk assessment: ✓
- Implementation plan: ✗ (Minor issue with timeline specificity)

## Issues Found
1. Implementation timeline could be more specific about dependencies between phases
2. Minor: Could benefit from more specific success metrics (e.g., exact performance thresholds)

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding specific timeline dependencies between phases
2. Add more granular performance metrics if available

## Compliance Check
- Complexity level: Appropriate for standard complexity
- Token count: 148/300 lines (well within limits)
- Required sections: Complete - all standard PRD sections present

## Status
- Ready for use: Yes
- Needs refinement: No
- Recommended next step: Ready for task generation with genT-1-assess-task-complexity.mdc

## Quality Assessment Details

### Strengths
- Clear problem statement with specific technical context
- Well-defined scope with explicit inclusions and exclusions
- Comprehensive user stories covering all stakeholder perspectives
- Detailed functional requirements with specific technical guidance
- Realistic implementation phases with clear deliverables
- Appropriate risk identification with mitigation strategies
- Measurable success criteria

### Minor Areas for Enhancement
- Timeline estimates could include buffer for testing phases
- Success metrics could include specific performance benchmarks
- Could benefit from explicit rollback strategy in risk mitigation

### Technical Accuracy
- Correctly references existing infrastructure (StructlogFactory, correlation_id_ctx)
- Accurate scope assessment (51 files, 440+ logger calls)
- Appropriate complexity level for system-wide migration
- Realistic timeline for the scope of work

The PRD is well-structured, comprehensive, and ready for implementation planning.
