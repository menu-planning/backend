## Complexity Determination
**Level**: detailed
**Reasoning**: System-wide refactoring across 51 files with 440+ logger calls, migration from standard to structured logging, performance/security critical requirements, and risk of breaking existing functionality

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: refactoring/migration
- **Scope**: existing code modification across entire src/ directory
- **Test Coverage**: needs comprehensive assessment and enhancement

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Performance degradation, correlation ID context loss, breaking log format compatibility
- **Dependencies**: StructlogFactory, correlation_id_ctx, ELK/CloudWatch systems
- **Breaking Potential**: High - logging is critical infrastructure used throughout application

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: detailed
- **Testing Strategy**: comprehensive with performance validation and correlation ID testing
- **Special Considerations**: Maintain ELK/CloudWatch compatibility, preserve correlation ID functionality

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 5 phases (Phase 0: Prerequisites + 4 implementation phases from PRD)
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 needed: yes (setup and validation tools)
- **Estimated Complexity**: 12-16 days (PRD estimates 12 days + buffer for detailed approach)

## Next Step
Ready for task structure generation with genT-2-create-task-folders.mdc
