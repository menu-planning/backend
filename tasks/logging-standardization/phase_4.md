## Objective
Comprehensive validation of the logging migration including correlation ID functionality, ELK/CloudWatch compatibility, performance testing, and final documentation.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase 3 optimization completed
- [ ] All previous validations passing
- [ ] No sensitive data in log statements

# Tasks

## 4.1 Correlation ID Validation
- [ ] 4.1.1 Test correlation ID propagation
  - Command: `python artifacts/test_correlation_ids.py --comprehensive`
  - Purpose: Ensure correlation IDs appear in all log entries
- [ ] 4.1.2 Test async operation correlation
  - Files: Async service methods and middleware
  - Purpose: Verify correlation ID context preservation across async boundaries
- [ ] 4.1.3 Test middleware correlation integration
  - Files: `src/contexts/shared_kernel/middleware/`
  - Purpose: Validate correlation ID injection and propagation

## 4.2 ELK/CloudWatch Compatibility
- [ ] 4.2.1 Validate JSON log format
  - Command: Sample log output and validate JSON structure
  - Purpose: Ensure logs parse correctly in aggregation systems
- [ ] 4.2.2 Test log field consistency
  - Validation: All logs contain required fields (@timestamp, level, logger, correlation_id)
  - Purpose: Maintain compatibility with existing dashboards
- [ ] 4.2.3 Verify log parsing
  - Command: Test log entries with JSON parser
  - Purpose: Ensure no malformed JSON in log output

## 4.3 Performance Testing
- [ ] 4.3.1 Run comprehensive performance benchmarks
  - Command: `python artifacts/benchmark_logging.py --full-suite`
  - Purpose: Measure logging overhead across different scenarios
- [ ] 4.3.2 Load test critical paths
  - Files: High-traffic endpoints and services
  - Purpose: Ensure no performance degradation under load
- [ ] 4.3.3 Memory usage analysis
  - Command: Profile memory usage with structured logging
  - Purpose: Verify no memory leaks or excessive allocation

## 4.4 Integration Testing
- [ ] 4.4.1 End-to-end logging flow test
  - Purpose: Test complete request flow with correlation ID tracking
- [ ] 4.4.2 Error scenario testing
  - Purpose: Verify error logging provides sufficient context
- [ ] 4.4.3 Multi-context operation testing
  - Purpose: Test logging across different bounded contexts

## 4.5 Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] 4.5.1 Update logging documentation
  - Files: Create/update logging guidelines for team
  - Purpose: Establish standards for future development
- [ ] 4.5.2 Create migration completion report
  - Files: `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/completion_report.md`
  - Purpose: Document migration results and metrics
- [ ] 4.5.3 Clean up temporary files
  - Files: Remove baseline files and temporary scripts
  - Purpose: Clean repository state

## 4.6 Final Validation
- [ ] 4.6.1 Complete test suite execution
  - Command: `poetry run python pytest tests/ --cov=src/ --cov-report=html`
  - Purpose: Ensure all functionality intact
- [ ] 4.6.2 Static analysis validation
  - Command: `poetry run python mypy src/`
  - Purpose: Verify type safety maintained
- [ ] 4.6.3 Migration completeness check
  - Command: `python artifacts/validate_migration.py --final`
  - Purpose: Confirm 100% migration completion

## Validation
- [ ] Tests: All tests passing with >90% coverage
- [ ] Performance: <5% degradation from baseline
- [ ] Correlation IDs: Present in 100% of log entries
- [ ] JSON Format: All logs parse correctly
- [ ] Security: No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Documentation: Team guidelines updated
- [ ] Migration: 0 remaining standard logger usage
