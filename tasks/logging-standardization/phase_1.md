# Phase 1: Audit & Analysis

---
phase: 1
depends_on: [phase_0]
estimated_time: 16 hours
risk_level: low
---

## Objective
Comprehensive audit of current logging patterns across all 51 files to identify migration requirements, log placement issues, and standardization opportunities.

## Prerequisites
git - [x] Phase 0 completed successfully
- [x] Validation tools available in artifacts/
- [x] Baseline measurements captured

# Tasks

## 1.1 Logging Pattern Analysis
- [x] 1.1.1 Analyze standard logger imports
  - Files: All files in `src/contexts/`
  - Command: `find src/ -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "import logging" {} \;`
  - Purpose: Identify files requiring import migration
- [x] 1.1.2 Analyze logger instantiation patterns
  - Command: `grep -r "logging.getLogger" src/ --include="*.py"`
  - Purpose: Document current logger creation patterns
- [x] 1.1.3 Analyze existing structlog usage
  - Command: `grep -r "structlog" src/ --include="*.py"`
  - Purpose: Identify files already using structured logging

## 1.2 Log Placement Audit
- [x] 1.2.1 Audit critical business operations
  - Files: `src/contexts/*/core/services/`
  - Purpose: Ensure important operations are logged
- [x] 1.2.2 Audit error handling patterns
  - Files: `src/contexts/*/core/adapters/`
  - Purpose: Verify error conditions have appropriate logging
- [x] 1.2.3 Identify over-logging patterns
  - Command: `grep -r "logger.debug" src/ | wc -l`
  - Purpose: Find potentially excessive debug logging

## 1.3 Message Quality Assessment
- [x] 1.3.1 Analyze log message formats
  - Command: `grep -r "logger\.(info\|error\|warning)" src/ > artifacts/current_messages.txt`
  - Purpose: Document current message patterns
  - Files: `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/current_messages.txt`, `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/message_pattern_analysis.md`
  - Results: 191 log messages found (90 info, 50 error, 49 warning), 7 already structured, 26 private instances
- [x] 1.3.2 Identify sensitive data exposure
  - Files: Review authentication and user data handling files
  - Purpose: Ensure no PII/secrets in log messages
  - Files: `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/sensitive_data_audit.md`
  - Results: MEDIUM risk - User IDs logged, IAM response bodies in errors, exception details exposed
- [x] 1.3.3 Assess correlation ID usage
  - Command: `grep -r "correlation_id" src/ --include="*.py"`
  - Purpose: Verify current correlation ID implementation
  - Files: `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/correlation_id_usage.txt`, `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/correlation_id_analysis.md`
  - Results: EXCELLENT implementation - 202 references, 77 Lambda functions, ContextVar-based, migration-ready

## 1.4 Documentation Creation
- [x] 1.4.1 Create migration report
  - Files: `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/migration_report.md`
  - Purpose: Document findings and migration plan
  - Results: Comprehensive report covering 51 files, 440 calls, performance concerns (50% impact), excellent correlation ID system
- [x] 1.4.2 Create file-by-file migration checklist
  - Files: `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/file_checklist.md`
  - Purpose: Track per-file migration progress
  - Results: 109 files categorized by priority (95 P1, 5 P2, 5 P3, 4 P4), migration phases defined
- [x] 1.4.3 Identify high-risk files
  - Purpose: Flag files requiring extra care during migration
  - Files: `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/high_risk_files.md`
  - Results: 12 high-risk files identified (4 critical, 4 high, 4 medium) with specialized migration strategies

## Validation
- [x] Lint: `uv run ruff check src/` (logging-related issues only)
- [x] Migration report contains all 51 files from src/ directory
- [x] High-risk files identified and documented
- [x] Baseline comparison shows current state
- [x] Confirmed tests/ directory excluded from analysis
