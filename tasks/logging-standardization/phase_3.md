# Phase 3: Optimization & Standardization

---
phase: 3
depends_on: [phase_2]
estimated_time: 24 hours
risk_level: medium
---

## Objective
Optimize log placement based on audit findings, standardize message formats, and implement consistent structured data patterns across all modules.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase 2 migration completed successfully
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within acceptable range

# Tasks

## 3.1 Log Placement Optimization
- [ ] 3.1.1 Add missing critical operation logs
  - Files: Business logic files identified in audit
  - Pattern: Add entry/exit logging for important operations
  - Purpose: Improve observability of key business processes
- [ ] 3.1.2 Remove redundant logging
  - Files: Files with excessive debug logging identified in audit
  - Purpose: Reduce noise and improve performance
- [ ] 3.1.3 Enhance error context logging
  - Files: Exception handling code
  - Pattern: Add relevant context (IDs, parameters, state)
  - Purpose: Improve debugging capability

## 3.2 Message Format Standardization
- [ ] 3.2.1 Standardize business operation messages
  - Files: `src/contexts/*/core/services/`
  - Pattern: Use consistent action-based messages
  - Example: `logger.info("User created", user_id=user_id, action="create")`
  - Purpose: Enable better log analysis and alerting
- [ ] 3.2.2 Standardize error messages
  - Files: Error handling code across all contexts
  - Pattern: Include error_type, context, and resolution hints
  - Purpose: Improve error diagnosis and resolution
- [ ] 3.2.3 Standardize performance logging
  - Files: Repository and external service calls
  - Pattern: Include timing, operation_type, and resource identifiers
  - Purpose: Enable performance monitoring and optimization

## 3.3 Structured Data Patterns
- [ ] 3.3.1 Implement consistent field naming
  - Pattern: Use snake_case for all log fields
  - Standard fields: user_id, request_id, operation_type, duration_ms
  - Purpose: Enable consistent log parsing and analysis
- [ ] 3.3.2 Add contextual metadata
  - Pattern: Include relevant business context in all log entries
  - Files: Service and repository classes
  - Purpose: Improve log searchability and debugging
- [ ] 3.3.3 Implement log level consistency
  - Pattern: DEBUG for detailed flow, INFO for business events, WARNING for recoverable issues, ERROR for failures
  - Files: All migrated files
  - Purpose: Enable effective log filtering and alerting

## 3.4 Security and Compliance
- [ ] 3.4.1 Remove sensitive data from logs
  - Files: Authentication and user data handling files
  - Pattern: Exclude PII, passwords, tokens from log messages
  - Purpose: Ensure compliance and security
- [ ] 3.4.2 Add security event logging
  - Files: Authentication and authorization code
  - Pattern: Log security-relevant events with appropriate detail
  - Purpose: Enable security monitoring and audit trails
- [ ] 3.4.3 Validate log data sanitization
  - Command: `grep -r "password\|token\|secret" src/ --include="*.py" | grep logger`
  - Purpose: Ensure no sensitive data in log statements

## Validation
- [ ] Tests: `poetry run python pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] Lint: `poetry run python ruff check src/`
- [ ] Security check: No sensitive data in log statements
- [ ] Message format consistency check across all contexts
- [ ] Log level appropriateness review
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
