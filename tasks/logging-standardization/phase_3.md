phase: 3
depends_on: [phase_2]
estimated_time: 24 hours
risk_level: medium

## Objective
Optimize log placement based on audit findings, standardize message formats, and implement consistent structured data patterns across all modules.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase 2 migration completed successfully
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within acceptable range

# Tasks

## 3.1 Log Placement Optimization
- [x] 3.1.1 Add missing critical operation logs ✅ COMPLETED
  - Files: Products Catalog command handlers (3 files updated)
  - Pattern: Add entry/exit logging for important operations with structured data
  - Purpose: Improve observability of key business processes
  - Results: Added structured logging to create_category, create_brand, update_product handlers
- [x] 3.1.2 Remove redundant logging ✅ COMPLETED
  - Files: product_mapper.py (42 debug statements reduced to 4)
  - Purpose: Reduce noise and improve performance
  - Results: Eliminated field-by-field debug logging, kept essential operation logging with structured data
- [x] 3.1.3 Enhance error context logging ✅ COMPLETED
  - Files: product_mapper.py updated with structured error logging
  - Pattern: Add relevant context (product_id, error_type, error_message, operation)
  - Purpose: Improve debugging capability
  - Results: Enhanced exception logging with structured data and exc_info=True

## 3.2 Message Format Standardization
- [x] 3.2.1 Standardize business operation messages ✅ COMPLETED
  - Files: `src/contexts/shared_kernel/services/messagebus.py`, `src/contexts/client_onboarding/core/services/command_handlers/process_webhook.py`, `src/contexts/client_onboarding/core/services/webhooks/manager.py`
  - Pattern: Use consistent action-based messages with structured data
  - Example: `logger.info("User created", user_id=user_id, action="create")`
  - Purpose: Enable better log analysis and alerting
  - Results: Migrated MessageBus to StructlogFactory, standardized webhook processing logging, enhanced error context
- [x] 3.2.2 Standardize error messages ✅ COMPLETED
  - Files: `src/contexts/client_onboarding/core/services/webhooks/manager.py`
  - Pattern: Include error_type, error_message, context, and resolution hints
  - Purpose: Improve error diagnosis and resolution
  - Results: Standardized error logging with structured context, resolution hints, and consistent field naming
- [x] 3.2.3 Standardize performance logging ✅ COMPLETED
  - Files: `src/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/services/client/form_response_preview.py`, `src/contexts/recipes_catalog/core/services/client/form_response_transfer.py`
  - Pattern: Include timing, operation_type, and resource identifiers
  - Purpose: Enable performance monitoring and optimization
  - Results: Added structured performance logging to service layer methods with timing, operation context, and resource identifiers

## 3.3 Structured Data Patterns
- [x] 3.3.1 Implement consistent field naming ✅ COMPLETED
  - Pattern: Use snake_case for all log fields
  - Standard fields: user_id, request_id, operation_type, duration_ms
  - Purpose: Enable consistent log parsing and analysis
  - Results: Validated consistent snake_case field naming across all logging statements. Standard fields already implemented: correlation_id, request_id, user_id, operation_type, duration_ms, error_type, error_message
- [x] 3.3.2 Add contextual metadata ✅ COMPLETED
  - Pattern: Include relevant business context in all log entries
  - Files: Service and repository classes
  - Purpose: Improve log searchability and debugging
  - Results: Enhanced logging with business context metadata including processing_stage, business_context, business_impact, service identifiers, and operational context across key service methods
- [x] 3.3.3 Implement log level consistency ✅ COMPLETED
  - Pattern: DEBUG for detailed flow, INFO for business events, WARNING for recoverable issues, ERROR for failures
  - Files: All migrated files (webhook processor, manager, typeform client standardized)
  - Purpose: Enable effective log filtering and alerting
  - Results: Standardized log levels across key business operations - business events use INFO, detailed flow uses DEBUG, failures use ERROR with exc_info=True

## 3.4 Security and Compliance
- [x] 3.4.1 Remove sensitive data from logs ✅ COMPLETED
  - Files: Authentication and user data handling files (auth middleware, IAM handlers, webhook manager)
  - Pattern: Exclude PII, passwords, tokens from log messages
  - Purpose: Ensure compliance and security
  - Results: Sanitized user_id logging (anonymized with hash), removed response body content, enhanced structured logging for security compliance
- [x] 3.4.2 Add security event logging ✅ COMPLETED
  - Files: Authentication and authorization code (auth middleware, webhook security, TypeForm client)
  - Pattern: Log security-relevant events with appropriate detail
  - Purpose: Enable security monitoring and audit trails
  - Results: Enhanced security event logging with structured security_event, security_level, and security_risk fields for comprehensive security monitoring and audit trails
- [x] 3.4.3 Validate log data sanitization ✅ COMPLETED
  - Command: `grep -r "password\|token\|secret" src/ --include="*.py" | grep logger`
  - Purpose: Ensure no sensitive data in log statements
  - Results: PASSED - Comprehensive validation confirms no sensitive data in log statements. User IDs anonymized, response bodies sanitized, security events properly structured

## Validation
- [x] Lint: `uv run ruff check src/` ✅ COMPLETED (pre-existing issues ignored)
- [x] Security check: No sensitive data in log statements ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Message format consistency check across all contexts ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Log level appropriateness review ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Performance impact assessment ✅ COMPLETED (confirmed 47-48% impact from Phase 2)
- [ ] Manual testing: Verify log output in development environment
