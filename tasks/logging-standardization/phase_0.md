## Objective
Establish tooling, validation scripts, and baseline measurements needed for safe logging migration across the codebase.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Access to src/ directory
- [ ] Poetry environment configured
- [ ] Git branch created for logging migration

# Tasks

## 0.1 Environment Setup
- [ ] 0.1.1 Create migration branch
  - Command: `git checkout -b feature/logging-standardization`
  - Purpose: Isolate changes for safe development
- [ ] 0.1.2 Verify StructlogFactory availability
  - Files: `src/logging/logger.py`
  - Purpose: Confirm target logging infrastructure is ready
- [ ] 0.1.3 Install additional testing dependencies
  - Command: `poetry add --group dev pytest-benchmark`
  - Purpose: Enable performance testing for logging overhead

## 0.2 Validation Tools
- [ ] 0.2.1 Create migration validation script
  - Files: `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/validate_migration.py`
  - Purpose: Automated checking of migration completeness
- [ ] 0.2.2 Create performance benchmark script
  - Files: `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/benchmark_logging.py`
  - Purpose: Measure logging performance before/after migration
- [ ] 0.2.3 Create correlation ID test script
  - Files: `tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/test_correlation_ids.py`
  - Purpose: Validate correlation ID propagation

## 0.3 Baseline Measurements
- [ ] 0.3.1 Document current logger usage
  - Command: `grep -r "import logging" src/ > artifacts/current_imports.txt`
  - Purpose: Baseline for migration tracking
- [ ] 0.3.2 Document current logger calls
  - Command: `grep -r "logger\." src/ > artifacts/current_calls.txt`
  - Purpose: Track migration progress
- [ ] 0.3.3 Run performance baseline
  - Command: `python artifacts/benchmark_logging.py --baseline`
  - Purpose: Establish performance comparison point

## Validation
- [ ] Tests: `poetry run python pytest --version`
- [ ] Lint: `poetry run python ruff check tasks/logging-standardization/artifacts/`
- [ ] Validation scripts executable and produce expected output
- [ ] Baseline files created in artifacts/ directory
