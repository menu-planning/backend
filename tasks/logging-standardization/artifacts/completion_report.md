   - Lazy evaluation of log messages
   - Conditional logging based on level
   - Async logging for high-throughput scenarios

2. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Leverage correlation IDs for:
   - Distributed tracing integration
   - Error correlation across services
   - Performance bottleneck identification

3. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review of:
   - Log volume and relevance
   - Performance impact trends
   - Security compliance maintenance
