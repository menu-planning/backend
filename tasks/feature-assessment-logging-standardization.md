## Feature Overview
**Description**: Standardize logging across the application by migrating to structured logging, optimizing log placement, and improving log message quality
**Primary Problem**: Inconsistent logging patterns with mix of standard and structured loggers, suboptimal log placement, and unclear log messages
**Business Value**: Improved observability, faster debugging, better production monitoring, and enhanced developer experience

## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: System-wide changes affecting multiple components, requires migration strategy, involves performance considerations, but no external integrations or compliance requirements

## Scope Definition
**In-Scope**: 
- Migrate all logging from standard logger to structured logger (structlog)
- Audit and optimize log placement across all src/ modules
- Improve log message clarity and consistency
- Maintain existing correlation ID functionality
- Preserve ELK/CloudWatch compatibility

**Out-of-Scope**: 
- Changes to logging infrastructure (logger.py)
- Test files logging patterns
- External service logging configurations
- Log aggregation or monitoring tools setup

**Constraints**: 
- Must maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Cannot break existing correlation ID tracking
- Must preserve ELK/CloudWatch JSON format
- Target only src/ directory (51 files with 440+ logger usages)

## Requirements Profile
**Users**: Development team, DevOps, Production support
**Use Cases**: 
- Developers debugging issues in development
- Production troubleshooting and monitoring
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Audit trail and compliance tracking

**Success Criteria**: 
- 100% migration from standard to structured logging
- Consistent log message format across all modules
- Optimal log placement (no over/under logging)
- Maintained correlation ID functionality
- No performance degradation

## Technical Considerations
**Integrations**: Existing ELK/CloudWatch logging infrastructure
**Performance**: Minimal impact on application performance
**Security**: Ensure no sensitive data in logs (PII, secrets)
**Compliance**: Maintain existing audit trail capabilities

## PRD Generation Settings
