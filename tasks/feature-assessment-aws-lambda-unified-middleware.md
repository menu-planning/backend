## Feature Overview
**Description**: Consolidate and standardize AWS Lambda logging, error handling, and authentication middleware across all contexts to eliminate duplication, inconsistencies, and overlapping implementations.
**Primary Problem**: Multiple duplicate implementations of middleware patterns across different contexts, leading to maintenance overhead, inconsistent behavior, and potential security vulnerabilities.
**Business Value**: Improved maintainability, consistent user experience, reduced security risks, and streamlined development workflow.

## Complexity Determination
**Level**: detailed
**Reasoning**: This is a system-wide architectural change affecting multiple services, involves security-critical authentication improvements, requires careful migration planning, and impacts the entire Lambda execution pipeline across all contexts.

## Scope Definition
**In-Scope**: 
- Consolidate authentication middleware from shared_kernel and client_onboarding
- Standardize error handling patterns across all Lambda functions
- Unify logging middleware implementation and configuration
- Create consistent exception handling decorators
- Migrate existing Lambda functions to use unified middleware
- Establish middleware composition patterns

**Out-of-Scope**: 
- Changes to non-Lambda endpoints
- Modifications to business logic within Lambda functions
- Changes to external service integrations
- Database schema modifications

**Constraints**: 
- Must maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Cannot break existing Lambda function contracts
- Must preserve existing security policies and compliance requirements

## Requirements Profile
**Users**: 
- Primary: Backend developers maintaining Lambda functions
- Secondary: DevOps engineers, security team, QA engineers

**Use Cases**: 
- New Lambda function development with consistent middleware
- Migration of existing Lambda functions to unified patterns
- Centralized middleware configuration and updates
- Consistent error handling and logging across all contexts

**Success Criteria**: 
- Zero duplicate middleware implementations
- 100% consistency in error response formats
- Unified authentication patterns across all contexts
- Standardized logging format and configuration
- Reduced middleware maintenance overhead by 80%

## Technical Considerations
**Integrations**: 
- All existing Lambda functions across contexts
- AWS Lambda runtime environment
- Existing authentication providers and policies
- Current logging and monitoring systems

**Performance**: 
- Middleware overhead must be <5ms per request
- No impact on Lambda cold start times
- Efficient error handling without performance degradation

**Security**: 
- Maintain existing security policies
- Consistent authentication validation
- Secure error message handling (no information leakage)
- Audit trail preservation

**Compliance**: 
- Maintain existing compliance requirements
- Consistent audit logging across all contexts
- Error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
