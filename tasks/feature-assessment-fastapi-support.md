feature: fastapi-support

complexity: detailed
---

## Feature Overview
**Description**: Add FastAPI runtime support to the existing menu planning backend, enabling local development and Railway deployment while maintaining compatibility with existing AWS Lambda infrastructure.

**Primary Problem**: Current system only supports AWS Lambda deployment, limiting local development and deployment flexibility. Need to support FastAPI for better development experience and deployment options.

**Business Value**: 
- Improved developer experience with local FastAPI server
- Railway deployment with automatic containerization
- Better debugging and development tooling
- Reduced vendor lock-in

## Complexity Determination
**Level**: detailed
**Reasoning**: 
- Core system changes: Adding new runtime alongside existing AWS Lambda
- Multiple services: 4 business contexts need FastAPI adaptation
- Security critical: New Cognito authentication strategy with token handling
- Integration complexity: Reusing existing middleware system
- Architecture changes: Strategy pattern for authentication, dependency injection

## Scope Definition
**In-Scope**: 
- FastAPI application structure and routing
- FastAPI authentication strategy for Cognito
- Middleware adaptation for FastAPI
- Context-specific FastAPI endpoints (4 contexts)
- Token validation and refresh handling
- Dependency injection for FastAPI
- CORS and security configuration
- Development and production configurations

**Out-of-Scope**: 
- Replacing AWS Lambda runtime (both will coexist)
- Changing business logic or domain models
- Modifying existing AWS Lambda endpoints
- Database schema changes
- User interface changes

**Constraints**: 
- Must reuse existing middleware system
- Must maintain API compatibility with Lambda endpoints
- Must support same authentication/authorization patterns
- Must work with existing dependency injection containers

## Requirements Profile
**Users**: 
- Primary: Backend developers (local development)
- Secondary: DevOps engineers (deployment flexibility)
- Tertiary: QA engineers (testing and debugging)

**Use Cases**: 
- Local development with FastAPI dev server
- Containerized deployment with FastAPI
- API testing and debugging
- Integration testing with real authentication

**Success Criteria**: 
- All 4 contexts have working FastAPI endpoints
- Cognito authentication works with token validation/refresh
- Existing middleware system reused effectively
- Local development server runs without AWS dependencies
- API responses match Lambda endpoint responses

## Technical Considerations
**Integrations**: 
- AWS Cognito for authentication
- Existing IAM internal endpoints
- Current middleware system (auth, logging, error handling)
- Database connections (PostgreSQL)
- Dependency injection containers

**Performance**: 
- Request-scoped caching for authentication
- Middleware performance optimization
- Token validation caching
- Database connection pooling

**Security**: 
- JWT token validation with Cognito
- Token refresh mechanism
- CORS configuration
- Request validation and sanitization

**Compliance**: 
- Maintain existing security patterns
- Audit logging compatibility
- Error handling consistency

## PRD Generation Settings
**Detail Level**: detailed
**Target Audience**: senior developers (complex architecture changes)
**Timeline**: flexible (significant development effort)
**Risk Level**: medium (architectural changes but well-defined scope)

## Recommended PRD Sections
