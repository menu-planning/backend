## Complexity Determination
**Level**: standard
**Reasoning**: While this involves system-wide refactoring and multiple services, the user specifically requested to keep it simple and production-ready. Standard complexity provides balanced guidance without overcomplication.

## Implementation Context
- **Type**: refactoring
- **Scope**: existing code modification + new components
- **Test Coverage**: existing tests in affected areas

## Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: Breaking existing Lambda functions, performance overhead
- **Dependencies**: All Lambda function source code, existing middleware implementations
- **Breaking Potential**: High - affects all Lambda functions across contexts

## User Preferences
- **Detail Level**: standard
- **Testing Strategy**: test-after with existing frameworks
- **Special Considerations**: Keep it simple, production-ready, avoid overcomplication

## Recommended Structure
- **Phases**: 3 phases (core infrastructure, migration, cleanup)
- **Prerequisites**: Phase 0 needed: no
- **Estimated Complexity**: 6-8 weeks
